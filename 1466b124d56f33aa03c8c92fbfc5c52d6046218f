The next steps doesn\u0027t have to be to merge patches. It could be as simple as knowing about a weather item which may not impact the project.\n\nThe idea to let a proxy be someone other than a committer was also to cover the initial release for projects like netconf that have light committer activity to have coverage. Yes, if a committer doesn\u0027t make it to the meetings then that is a bad sign and will be corrected. But that is a situation that takes time to correct.",
