      "message": "The original intent wasn\u0027t for the proxy to be able to react quickly or merge patches, the intent was to make sure the project was aware of information from the TSC. The next steps doesn\u0027t have to be to merge patches. It could be as simple as knowing about a weather item which may not impact the project.\n\nThe idea to let a proxy be someone other than a committer was also to cover the initial release for projects like netconf that have light committer activity to have coverage. Yes, if a committer doesn\u0027t make it to the meetings then that is a bad sign and will be corrected. But that is a situation that takes time to correct.",
