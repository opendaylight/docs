=== OpenStack with OVSDB

'''Prerequisites:''' OpenDaylight requires Java 1.7.0.

* On the control host, http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads[Download
  the latest OpenDaylight release] (at the time of writing, this is
  0.2.1-Helium-SR1.1)
* Uncompress it as root, and start OpenDaylight (you can start OpenDaylight
  by running karaf directly, but exiting from the shell will shut it down):
....
$ tar xvfz distribution-karaf-0.2.1-Helium-SR1.1.tar.gz
$ cd distribution-karaf-0.2.0-Helium
$ ./bin/start # Start OpenDaylight as a server process
....
* Connect to the Karaf shell, and install the odl-ovsdb-openstack bundle,
  dlux and their dependencies:
....
$ ./bin/client # Connect to OpenDaylight with the client
opendaylight-user@root> feature:install odl-base-all odl-aaa-authn odl-restconf odl-nsf-all odl-adsal-northbound odl-mdsal-apidocs \
odl-ovsdb-openstack odl-ovsdb-northbound odl-dlux-core
....
* If everything is installed correctly, you should now be able to log in to
  the dlux interface on `http://$CONTROL_HOST:8181/dlux/index.html` - the
  default username and password is "admin/admin" (see screenshot below)

==== Ensuring OpenStack network state is clean

When using OpenDaylight as the Neutron back-end, ODL expects to be the only
source of truth for Open vSwitch configuration. Because of this, it is
necessary to remove existing OpenStack and Open vSwitch configurations to
give OpenDaylight a clean slate.

* Delete instances
....
$ nova list
$ nova delete <instance names>
....
* Remove link from subnets to routers
....
$ neutron subnet-list
$ neutron router-list
$ neutron router-port-list <router name>
$ neutron router-interface-delete <router name> <subnet ID or name>
....
* Delete subnets, nets, routers
....
$ neutron subnet-delete <subnet name>
$ neutron net-list
$ neutron net-delete <net name>
$ neutron router-delete <router name>
....
* Check that all ports have been cleared - at this point, this should be an
  empty list
....
$ neutron port-list
....

==== Ensure Neutron is stopped

While Neutron is managing the OVS instances on compute and control nodes,
OpenDaylight and Neutron can be in conflict. To prevent issues, we turn off
Neutron server on the network controller, and Neutron's Open vSwitch agents
on all hosts.

* Turn off neutron-server on control node
....
# systemctl stop neutron-server
....
* On each node in the cluster, shut down and disable Neutron's agent services to ensure that they do not restart after a reboot:
....
# systemctl stop neutron-openvswitch-agent
# systemctl disable neutron-openvswitch-agent
....

==== Configuring Open vSwitch to be managed by OpenDaylight

On each host (both compute and control nodes) we will clear the pre-existing
Open vSwitch config and set OpenDaylight to manage the switch:

* Stop the Open vSwitch service, and clear existing OVSDB (ODL expects to
manage vSwitches completely)
....
# systemctl stop openvswitch
# rm -rf /var/log/openvswitch/*
# rm -rf /etc/openvswitch/conf.db
# systemctl start openvswitch
....
* At this stage, your Open vSwitch configuration should be empty:
....
[root@dneary-odl-compute2 ~]# ovs-vsctl show
9f3b38cb-eefc-4bc7-828b-084b1f66fbfd
    ovs_version: "2.1.3"
....
* Set OpenDaylight as the manager on all nodes
....
# ovs-vsctl set-manager tcp:${CONTROL_HOST}:6640
....
* You should now see a new section in your Open vSwitch configuration
  showing that you are connected to the OpenDaylight server, and OpenDaylight
  will automatically create a br-int bridge:
....
[root@dneary-odl-compute2 ~]# ovs-vsctl show
9f3b38cb-eefc-4bc7-828b-084b1f66fbfd
    Manager "tcp:172.16.21.56:6640"
        is_connected: true
    Bridge br-int
        Controller "tcp:172.16.21.56:6633"
        fail_mode: secure
        Port br-int
            Interface br-int
    ovs_version: "2.1.3"
....
* (BUG WORKAROUND) If SELinux is enabled, you may not have a security
  context in place which allows Open vSwitch remote administration. If you
  do not see the result above (specifically, if you do not see
  "is_connected: true" in the Manager section), set SELinux to Permissive
  mode on all nodes and ensure it stays that way after boot:
....
# setenforce 0
# sed -i -e 's/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config
....
* Make sure all nodes, including the control node, are connected to
  OpenDaylight
* If you reload DLUX, you should now see that all of your Open vSwitch nodes
  are now connected to OpenDaylight
+
[[File:Dlux with switches.png|center|thumbnail|400px|DLUX showing Open vSwitch nodes]]
* If something has gone wrong, check <code>data/log/karaf.log</code> under
  the OpenDaylight distribution directory. If you do not see any interesting
  log entries, set logging for OVSDB to TRACE level inside Karaf and try again:
....
log:set TRACE ovsdb
....

==== Configuring Neutron to use OpenDaylight

Once you have configured the vSwitches to connect to OpenDaylight, you can
now ensure that OpenStack Neutron is using OpenDaylight.

First, ensure that port 8080 (which will be used by OpenDaylight to listen
for REST calls) is available. By default, swift-proxy-service listens on the
same port, and you may need to move it (to another port or another host), or
disable that service. I moved it to port 8081 by editing
<code>/etc/swift/proxy-server.conf</code> and
<code>/etc/cinder/cinder.conf</code>, modifying iptables appropriately, and
restarting swift-proxy-service and OpenDaylight.

* Configure Neutron to use OpenDaylight's ML2 driver:
....
crudini --set /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini ml2 mechanism_drivers opendaylight 
crudini --set /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini ml2 tenant_network_types vxlan

cat <<EOT>> /etc/neutron/plugins/ml2/ml2_conf.ini
[ml2_odl]
password = admin
username = admin
url = http://${CONTROL_HOST}:8080/controller/nb/v2/neutron
EOT
....
* Reset Neutron's ML2 database
....
mysql -e "drop database if exists neutron_ml2;"
mysql -e "create database neutron_ml2 character set utf8;"
mysql -e "grant all on neutron_ml2.* to 'neutron'@'%';"
neutron-db-manage --config-file /usr/share/neutron/neutron-dist.conf --config-file /etc/neutron/neutron.conf \
--config-file /etc/neutron/plugin.ini upgrade head
....
* Restart neutron-server:
    systemctl start neutron-server

==== Verifying it works

* Verify that OpenDaylight's ML2 interface is working:
....
curl -u admin:admin http://${CONTROL_HOST}:8080/controller/nb/v2/neutron/networks

{
   "networks" : [ ]
}
....

If this does not work or gives an error, check Neutron's log file in
<code>/var/log/neutron/server.log</code>. Error messages here should give
some clue as to what the problem is in the connection with OpenDaylight

* Create a net, subnet, router, connect ports, and start an instance using
the Neutron CLI:
....
neutron router-create router1
neutron net-create private
neutron subnet-create private --name=private_subnet 10.10.5.0/24
neutron router-interface-add router1 private_subnet
nova boot --flavor <flavor> --image <image id> --nic net-id=<network id> test1
nova boot --flavor <flavor> --image <image id> --nic net-id=<network id> test2
....

At this point, you have confirmed that OpenDaylight is creating network
end-points for instances on your network and managing traffic to them.

Congratulations! You're done!
