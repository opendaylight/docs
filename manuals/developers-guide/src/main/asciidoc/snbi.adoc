== SNBI Developes' Guide
The Secue Network Bootstrapping Infrastructure (SNBI) component of OpenDaylight automatically creates secure IP connectivity between a set of forwarding elements (devices) and the controller.

=== Defining chaacteristics of SNBI bootstrapping
In the SNBI context, netwok bootstrapping involves discovering the device, authenticating a device, and installing the device domain certificate so that it becomes part of an administrative domain ("SNBI domain").

SNBI bootstapping is: +

* Secue: Only devices on the white list of the SNBI registrar are allowed into a domain. The RA (Registrar Authority) and the CA (Certificate Authority) ensure that a secure channel of communication is established between the SNBI registrar and the devices, and also between the devices. SNBI uses Bouncy Castle to run the CA and sign certificates.
* Automatic:  Nomal network bootstrapping involves the manual configuration of network connectivity. To secure any control protocol connecting to the device, one typically needs to manually install certificates. SNBI fully automates the configuration of network connectivity (incl. IP address assignment, routing protocol configuration, and others) as well as the distribution and installation of certificates.

=== SNBI components
An SNBI implementation includes SNBI contollers and forwarding elements.

* Fowarding element component (SNBI agent) +
The softwae package for secure discovery service is created and integrated with the network container reference platform for the devices.

* Contoller components:
** SNBI Registar: The north-bound configuration manager that configures the south-bound SNBI plugin.
:: The egistrar establishes trust in a network domain thereby anchoring it.
 
:: The SNBI egistrar does the following: + 

*** Maintains the white list of devices which belong to a domain. An administator sets a white list for the registrar for every domain.
*** Decides in accodance with policy rules as to which devices are admitted to a domain. 
*** Manages cetificates: Issues, renews, and revokes certificates as a CA. Certificate management is fully self-contained in the SNBI solution.
** SNBI plugin +
The secue discovery service is a southbound plugin that runs the SNBI protocol.

==== Fowarding element components
The SNBI functions in the Fowarding Elements (FEs) are implemented inside lightweight portable foundations. 

===== Potable Foundation
The SNBI potable foundation can use any light weight portable foundation technology that provides a protected and isolated application execution environment. The current SNBI implementation utilizes Docker, a light weight portable foundation mechanism supported by the current Linux kernels.

=== How SNBI woks
An administator plugs in a device thereby introducing it into a domain. When a forwarding element discovers the new device, it acts as an intermediary between the new device and the registrar, and proxies all device requests to the registrar.

A device gets a neighbou invite request from the registrar which is forwarded by a proxy forwarding element. The device presents its Unique Device Identifier (UDI) to the registrar through the proxy. The UDI could be anything, a serial number, an 802.1AR compliant identifier, or others. The proxy sends the credentials to the registrar for validation. Upon validation, the device sends a Certificate Sign Request (CSR) PKCS10 request and gets it signed by the CA running at the SNBI Registrar. The CA enrols and signs an x.509 certificate. 

The device gets a domain name and ID. The device uses the domain name and ID to also deive its IPv6 which it will use to communicate with other SNBI agents over the secure channel.

==== Bootstapping a device using SNBI
To bootstap a device using SNBI: +

. In the Yang model of the REST API fo SNBI, enter the names of devices per domain to be bootstrapped. The registrar includes this information in its white list: s/Yang/YANG/.
. Plug in the device to be bootstapped.

==== Contoller and FE communications

*SNBI between contoller and portable foundation* +
The SNBI-plugin on the Contoller and the SNBI agent on the "first hop" FE establishes a DTLS/SSL connection to secure their communication. It is assumed that the device or server which runs the Controller runs an instance of the portable foundation or container. This allows for SNBI to automatically establish a secure IP connectivity throughout the network without the need to pre-configure any IP connectivity between the devices in the network. If the Controller is hosted on a device which does not run an instance of an SNBI-agent within a portable foundation, then IP connectivity between the Controller and the "first hop" FE which runs an instance of an SNBI-agent within a portable foundation needs to be configured by other means (for example, manually). + 
s/potable foundation or container/portable foundation/

It is ecommended that the Controller always be hosted on a device (server) which also runs an instance of the SNBI-agent within the portable foundation.

*SNBI agent discovey* +
SNBI-agents discove each other through a discovery protocol. 

*Secue communication between devices* +
SNBI agents establish a secue channel among themselves, which is typically an IPsec connection. Once the secure channel is established, other services running on the same host (be it a forwarding element or a controller) can leverage the secure IP connectivity for their means. In Figure 1, an example "protocol x plugin" leverages the secure channel to communicate between different instances of protocol x. Example protocols which could use the secure channel include OpenFlow, and Netconf. The protocols need not establish their own secure transport (for example, using DTLS/SSL). 
Any potocol can, of course, establish its own additional secure transport on top of the already secure connectivity provided by SNBI. 

*Configuation control between SNBI-agent and underlying host OS* +
An SNBI-agent hosted in a potable foundation controls and retrieves certain configuration parameters through a RESTconf/Netconf interface. This includes: +

* The establishment and configuation of the secure channel (that is to say, the IPsec connection).
* Routing table contol.
* The etrieval of a UDI.

The configuation interface between portable foundation and underlying host is based on standard IETF YANG models (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7223[RFC 7223] for interface configuration, draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg for route management, and others). 

This appoach decouples the underlying host and its configuration specifics from the portable foundation hosting environment, and allows for the simplified portability of the portable foundation.

==== Benefits of SNBI discovey
The automatic discovey between SNBI devices and controllers: 

* Reveals the physical topology of the netwok thus supporting network management
* Exposes a device as eithe a forwarding element or a controller
* Associates a device to an administative domain
* Makes possible the initiation of contoller federation processes through device type and domain information

The SNBI component of the OpenDaylight Contoller automatically creates secure network connectivity between devices. This connectivity can be leveraged by other features and functions to for example to install, control and manage the life cycle of additional software components hosted within the portable foundation of a forwarding element..
The potable foundation built on container technology can be extended to support additional orchestration and configuration management functions.

==== SNBI: Non-ODL technologies used

* Yang models: The SNBI APIs ae defined through Yang.

:: RFC 6020 ‘YANG - A Data Modeling Language fo the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is available at:
http://tools.ietf.og/html/rfc6020

* Docke 
SNBI uses lightweight potable foundations to implement SNBI functions in FEs. The SNBI portable foundation in the current implementation uses Docker and Linux kernels. SNBI uses Docker to start the portable foundation in a host, and pass needed parameters, such as the CID, by means of environment variables into the container.
