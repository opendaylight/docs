= Overview

// FIXME: Should we use introduction from user manual / installation guide?
//        are this prerequisites for developers guide? If so, we should document
//        that explicitly here so we do not need to repeat same text
//          over-and-over

// FIXME: section_Git_and_Gerrit_Setup.adoc and section_Hacking_from_CLI.adoc
//        is much more contributor style documentation and not Developer
//        documentation for folks which wants to build on top of OpenDaylight.
