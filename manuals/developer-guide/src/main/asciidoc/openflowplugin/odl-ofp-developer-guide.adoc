== OpenFlow Plugin Project Developer Guide

Below are topics which are developer specific and which have not been
covered under the user guide. Please follow the OpenFlow plugin user
guide first.

==== Message Order Preservation

Currently it is in openflowplugin java allocated 2*number of processor's core threads (e. g. if machine with controller contain processor with 4 decates cores then for openflow java there si allocated 8 threads). One thread processes all of the messages from one or more devices which are assigned to this thread. Once message is processed then thread is released for processing other message from the same device or from some of dedicated devices.

In comparation to Helium plugin it isn't necessary to keep messages in the specific queues and it isn't necessary to provide special care about correct message processing which come from the same device.

=== Important dependant distributions

Some projects contain distributions which depends on OFPlugin and can be
easily broken. In case of upcomming change in OFPlugin capable of
breaking them (dependency change, configSubsystem change, stinky suspect
wild hack change.. etc.) these distribution should be tested on (*before
merge*) :

* ability to start and listen on default openflow ports (6633, 6653)
* ability to connect mininet with at least tree,2 topology
* ability to list mininet nodes via restconf

If there are issues, try to retest using OFPlugin without the change in
order to prove that OFPlugin is the cause. Then either push fixes to
those distributions or contact developers. This way we can avoid
blocking people developing against those distributions.

Those distributions are:
