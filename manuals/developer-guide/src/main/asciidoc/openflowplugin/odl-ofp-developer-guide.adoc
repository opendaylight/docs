=== Message Order Preservation

While the Helium release of OpenFlow Plugin relied on queues to ensure messages were delivered in order, subsequent releases instead ensure that all the messages from a given device are delivered using the same thread and thus message order is guaranteed without queues. The OpenFlow plugin allocates a number of threads equal to twice the number of processor cores on machine it is run, e.g., 8 threads if the machine has 4 cores.

NOTE:
While each device is assigned to one thread, multiple devices can be assigned to the same thread.
