=== Description of clustering singleton approach in plugin

==== Change against using EOS service listener

In this new clustering singleton approach plugin uses API from the MD-SAL project SingletonClusteringService which comes with three methods.

    instantiateServiceInstance()
    closeServiceInstance()
    getIdentifier()

This service has to be registered to a SingletonClusteringServiceProvider from MD-SAL which take care if mastership is changed in cluster environment. 

First method in SingletonClusteringService is being called when the cluster node becomes a MASTER. Second is being called when status changes to SLAVE or device is disconnected from cluster. Last method plugins returns NodeId as ServiceGroupIdentifier
Startup after device is connected

On the start up the plugin we need to initialize first four managers for each working area providing information and services

* Device manager
* RPC manager
* Role manager
* Statistics manager

After connection the device the listener Device manager get the event and start up to creating the context for this connection.
Startup after device connection

Services are managed by SinlgetonClusteringServiceProvider from MD-SAL project. So in startup we simply create a instance of LifecycleService and register all contexts into it.

==== Role change

Plugin is no longer registered as Entity Ownership Service (EOS) listener therefore does not need to and cannot respond on EOS ownership changes.

===== Service start

Services start asynchronously but the start is managed by LifecycleService. If something goes wrong LifecycleService stop starting services in context and this speeds up the reconnect process. But the services haven't changed and plugin need to start all this:

*    Activating transaction chain manager
*    Initial gathering of device statistics
*    Initial submit to DS
*    Sending role MASTER to device
*    RPC services registration
*    Statistics gathering start

===== Service stop

If closeServiceInstance occurred plugin just simply try to store all unsubmitted transactions and close the transaction chain manager, stop RPC services, stop Statistics gathering and after that all unregister txEntity from EOS.
