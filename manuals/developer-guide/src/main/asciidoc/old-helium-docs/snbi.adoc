== SNBI Developers' Guide
The Secure Network Bootstrapping Infrastructure (SNBI) component of OpenDaylight automatically creates secure IP connectivity between a set of forwarding elements (devices) and the controller.

=== Defining characteristics of SNBI bootstrapping
In the SNBI context, network bootstrapping involves discovering the device, authenticating a device, and installing the device domain certificate so that it becomes part of an administrative domain ("SNBI domain").

SNBI bootstrapping is: +

* Secure: Only devices on the white list of the SNBI registrar are allowed into a domain. The RA (Registrar Authority) and the CA (Certificate Authority) ensure that a secure channel of communication is established between the SNBI registrar and the devices, and also between the devices. SNBI uses Bouncy Castle to run the CA and sign certificates.
* Automatic:  Normal network bootstrapping involves the manual configuration of network connectivity. To secure any control protocol connecting to the device, one typically needs to manually install certificates. SNBI fully automates the configuration of network connectivity (incl. IP address assignment, routing protocol configuration, and others) as well as the distribution and installation of certificates.

=== SNBI components
An SNBI implementation includes SNBI controllers and forwarding elements.

* Forwarding element component (SNBI agent) +
The software package for secure discovery service is created and integrated with the network container reference platform for the devices.

* Controller components:
** SNBI Registrar: The north-bound configuration manager that configures the south-bound SNBI plugin.
:: The registrar establishes trust in a network domain thereby anchoring it.
 
:: The SNBI registrar does the following: + 

*** Maintains the white list of devices which belong to a domain. An administrator sets a white list for the registrar for every domain.
*** Decides in accordance with policy rules as to which devices are admitted to a domain. 
*** Manages certificates: Issues, renews, and revokes certificates as a CA. Certificate management is fully self-contained in the SNBI solution.
** SNBI plugin +
The secure discovery service is a southbound plugin that runs the SNBI protocol.

==== Forwarding element components
The SNBI functions in the Forwarding Elements (FEs) are implemented inside lightweight portable foundations. 

===== Portable Foundation
The SNBI portable foundation can use any light weight portable foundation technology that provides a protected and isolated application execution environment. The current SNBI implementation utilizes Docker, a light weight portable foundation mechanism supported by the current Linux kernels.

=== How SNBI works
An administrator plugs in a device thereby introducing it into a domain. When a forwarding element discovers the new device, it acts as an intermediary between the new device and the registrar, and proxies all device requests to the registrar.

A device gets a neighbour invite request from the registrar which is forwarded by a proxy forwarding element. The device presents its Unique Device Identifier (UDI) to the registrar through the proxy. The UDI could be anything, a serial number, an 802.1AR compliant identifier, or others. The proxy sends the credentials to the registrar for validation. Upon validation, the device sends a Certificate Sign Request (CSR) PKCS10 request and gets it signed by the CA running at the SNBI Registrar. The CA enrols and signs an x.509 certificate. 

The device gets a domain name and ID. The device uses the domain name and ID to also derive its IPv6 which it will use to communicate with other SNBI agents over the secure channel.

==== Bootstrapping a device using SNBI
To bootstrap a device using SNBI: +

. In the Yang model of the REST API for SNBI, enter the names of devices per domain to be bootstrapped. The registrar includes this information in its white list: s/Yang/YANG/.
. Plug in the device to be bootstrapped.

==== Controller and FE communications

*SNBI between controller and portable foundation* +
The SNBI-plugin on the Controller and the SNBI agent on the "first hop" FE establishes a DTLS/SSL connection to secure their communication. It is assumed that the device or server which runs the Controller runs an instance of the portable foundation or container. This allows for SNBI to automatically establish a secure IP connectivity throughout the network without the need to pre-configure any IP connectivity between the devices in the network. If the Controller is hosted on a device which does not run an instance of an SNBI-agent within a portable foundation, then IP connectivity between the Controller and the "first hop" FE which runs an instance of an SNBI-agent within a portable foundation needs to be configured by other means (for example, manually). + 
s/portable foundation or container/portable foundation/

It is recommended that the Controller always be hosted on a device (server) which also runs an instance of the SNBI-agent within the portable foundation.

*SNBI agent discovery* +
SNBI-agents discover each other through a discovery protocol. 

*Secure communication between devices* +
SNBI agents establish a secure channel among themselves, which is typically an IPsec connection. Once the secure channel is established, other services running on the same host (be it a forwarding element or a controller) can leverage the secure IP connectivity for their means. In Figure 1, an example "protocol x plugin" leverages the secure channel to communicate between different instances of protocol x. Example protocols which could use the secure channel include OpenFlow, and Netconf. The protocols need not establish their own secure transport (for example, using DTLS/SSL). 
Any protocol can, of course, establish its own additional secure transport on top of the already secure connectivity provided by SNBI. 

*Configuration control between SNBI-agent and underlying host OS* +
An SNBI-agent hosted in a portable foundation controls and retrieves certain configuration parameters through a RESTconf/Netconf interface. This includes: +

* The establishment and configuration of the secure channel (that is to say, the IPsec connection).
* Routing table control.
* The retrieval of a UDI.

The configuration interface between portable foundation and underlying host is based on standard IETF YANG models (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7223[RFC 7223] for interface configuration, draft-ietf-netmod-routing-cfg for route management, and others). 

This approach decouples the underlying host and its configuration specifics from the portable foundation hosting environment, and allows for the simplified portability of the portable foundation.

==== Benefits of SNBI discovery
The automatic discovery between SNBI devices and controllers: 

* Reveals the physical topology of the network thus supporting network management
* Exposes a device as either a forwarding element or a controller
* Associates a device to an administrative domain
* Makes possible the initiation of controller federation processes through device type and domain information

The SNBI component of the OpenDaylight Controller automatically creates secure network connectivity between devices. This connectivity can be leveraged by other features and functions to for example to install, control and manage the life cycle of additional software components hosted within the portable foundation of a forwarding element..
The portable foundation built on container technology can be extended to support additional orchestration and configuration management functions.

==== SNBI: Non-ODL technologies used

* Yang models: The SNBI APIs are defined through Yang.

:: RFC 6020 â€˜YANG - A Data Modeling Language for the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF) is available at:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6020

* Docker 
SNBI uses lightweight portable foundations to implement SNBI functions in FEs. The SNBI portable foundation in the current implementation uses Docker and Linux kernels. SNBI uses Docker to start the portable foundation in a host, and pass needed parameters, such as the CID, by means of environment variables into the container.
