==== odlparent-lite
This is the base parent for all OpenDaylight Maven projects and modules. It provides the following, notably to allow
publishing artifacts to Maven Central: +

* license information;
* organization information;
* issue management information (a link to our Bugzilla);
* continuous integration information (a link to our Jenkins setup);
* default Maven plugins (+maven-clean-plugin+, +maven-deploy-plugin+, +maven-install-plugin+,
  +maven-javadoc-plugin+ with HelpMojo support, +maven-project-info-reports-plugin+, +maven-site-plugin+ with
  Asciidoc support, +jdepend-maven-plugin+;
* distribution management information.

It also defines two profiles which help during development:

* +q+ (+-Pq+), the quick profile, which disables tests, code coverage, Javadoc generation, code analysis etc. â€”
  anything which isn't necessary to build the bundles and features (see
  http://blog2.vorburger.ch/2016/06/improve-maven-build-speed-with-q.html[this blog post] for details);
* +addInstallRepositoryPath+ (+-DaddInstallRepositoryPath=.../karaf/system+) which can be used to drop a bundle
  in the appropriate Karaf location, to enable hot-reloading of bundles during development (see
  http://blog2.vorburger.ch/2016/06/maven-install-into-additional.html[this blog post] for details).

For modules which don't produce any useful artifacts (_e.g._ aggregator POMs), you should add the following to avoid
processing artifacts:

--------------------------------------
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-deploy-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <skip>true</skip>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-install-plugin</artifactId>
            <configuration>
                <skip>true</skip>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
