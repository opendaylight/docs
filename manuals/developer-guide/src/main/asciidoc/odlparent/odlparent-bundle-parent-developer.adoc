==== bundle-parent
This inherits from +odlparent+ and enables functionality useful for OSGi bundles: +

* +maven-javadoc-plugin+ is activated, to build the Javadoc JAR;
* +maven-source-plugin+ is activated, to build the source JAR;
* +maven-bundle-plugin+ is activated (including extensions), to build OSGi bundles (using the “bundle” packaging).

In addition to this, JUnit is included as a default dependency in “test” scope.
