=== Parent POMs

==== Overview
The ODL Parent component for OpenDaylight provides a number of Maven parent POMs which allow Maven projects to be
easily integrated in the OpenDaylight ecosystem.
Technically, the aim of projects in OpenDaylight is to produce Karaf features, and these parent projects provide common
support for the different types of projects involved.

These parent projects are: +

* +odlparent-lite+ — the basic parent POM for Maven modules which don't produce artifacts (_e.g._ aggregator POMs)
* +odlparent+ — the common parent POM for Maven modules containing Java code
* +bundle-parent+ — the parent POM for Maven modules producing OSGi bundles
* +features-parent+ — the parent POM for Maven modules producing Karaf features
