== SNBI Developer Guide

=== Overview
Key distribution in a scaled network has always been a challenge. Typically, operators must perform some manual key distribution process before secure communication is possible between a set of network devices. The Secure Network Bootstrapping Infrastructure (SNBI) project securely and automatically brings up an integrated set of network devices and controllers, simplifying the process of bootstrapping network devices with the keys required for secure communication. SNBI enables connectivity to the network devices by assigning unique IPv6 addresses and bootstrapping devices with the required keys. Admission control of devices into a specific domain is achieved using whitelist of authorized devices.

=== SNBI Architecture
At a high level, SNBI architecture consists of the following components:

* SNBI Registrar
* SNBI Forwarding Element(FE)

==== SNBI Registrar
Registrar is a device in a network that validates device against a whitelist and delivers device domain certificate. Registrar includes the following:

* RestConf API for Domain Whitelist Configuration
* Certificate Authority
* SNBI South Plugin

.RestConf API for Domain Whitelist Configuration:
Restconf APIs are used to configure the whitelist set device in the registrar in the controller. The registrar interacts with the MD-SAL to obtain the whitelist set of devices and validate the device trying to join a domain. Furthermore it is possible to run multiple registrar instances pertaining to each domain.

.Certificate Authority:
A simple certificate authority is implemented using the Bouncy Castle package. The Certificate Authority creates the certificates from the device CSR requests received from the devices. The certificates thus generated are delievered to the devices using the South Plugin as discussed earlier.

.SNBI South Plugin:
The South Plugin implements the protocol state machine necessary to exchange device identifiers, and deliver certificates. The south plugin interacts with MD-SAL and the certificate authority to validate and create device domain certificates. The device domain certificate thus generated could be used to prove the validity of the devices within the domain.


==== SNBI Forwarding Element(FE)
The SNBI Forwarding Element run on linux machines which has to join the domain. The Device UDI or the device Identifier could be derived from a multitude of parameters in the host machine. But most of the parameters derived from the host are known ahead or doesn't remain constant across reloads. Therefore, each of the SNBI FE should be configured explicitly with a UDI that is already present in the device white list. The registrar service IP address must be provided to the first host (Forwarding Element) to be bootstrapped. As mentioned in the "Configuring the Registrar Host" section, the registrar service IP address is *fd08::aaaa:bbbb:1*. The First Forwarding Element must be configured with this IPv6 address.

The forwarding element must be installed or unpacked on a LINUX host whose network layer traffic must be secured. The FE performs the following functions:

* Neighour Discovery
* Bootstrapping with device domain certificates.
* Host Configuration

===== Neighbour Discovery:
Neighbour Discovery (ND) is the first step in accommodating devices in a secure network. SNBI performs periodic neighbour discovery of SNBI agents by transmitting ND hello packets. The discovered devices are populated in an ND table. Neighbour Discovery is periodic and bidirectional. ND hello packets are transmitted every 10 seconds. A 40 second refresh timer is set for each discovered neighbour. On expiry of the refresh timer, the Neighbour Adjacency is removed from the ND table as the Neighbour Adjacency is no longer valid.  It is possible that the same SNBI neighbour is discovered on multiple links, the expiry of a device on one link does not automatically remove the device entry from the ND table. In the exchange of ND keepalives, the device UDI is exchanged.

===== Bootstrapping with Device Domain Certificates:
Bootstrapping a device involves the following sequential steps:

* Authenticate a device using device identifier (UDI or SUDI) - The device identifier is exchanged in the hello  
* Allocate the appropriate device ID and IPv6 address to uniquely identify the device in the network
* Allocate the required keys by installing a Device Domain Certificate
* Accommodate the device in the domain

A device which is already bootstrapped acts as a proxy to bootstrap the new device which is trying to join the domain.

* Neighbour Invite phase - When a proxy device detects a new neighbor bootStrap connect message is initiated on behalf of the New device --*NEIGHBOUR CONNECT* Msg. The message is sent to the registrar to authenticate the device UDI against the whitelist of devices. The source IPv6 address is the proxy IPv6 address and the destination IPv6 address is the registrar IPv6 address. The SNBI Registrar provides appropriate device ID and IPv6 address to uniquely identify the device in the network and then invites the device to join the domain. -- *NEIGHBOUR INVITE* Msg.

* Neighbour Reject - If the Device UDI is not in the white list of devices, then the device is rejected and is not accepted into the domain. The proxy device just updates its DB with the reject information but still maintains the Neighbour relationship.

* Neighbour BootStrap Phase - Once the new device gets a neighbour invite message, it tries to boot strap itself by generating a key pair. The device generates a Certificate Sign Request(CSR) PKCS10 request and gets it signed by the CA running at the SNBI Registrar. -- *BS REQ* Msg. Once the certificate is enrolled and signed by the CA, the generated x.509 certificate is returned to the new device to complete the bootstrap process. -- *BS RESP* Msg.

==== Host Configuration:
Involves configuring a host to create a secure overlay network, assigning appropriate ipv6 address, setting up gre tunnels, securing the tunnels traffic via IPsec and enabling connectivity via a routing protocol. Docker is used to package all the required dependent software modules.

.SNBI Bootstrap Process

* Interace configuration: The Iproute2 package, which comes by default pacakaged in the linux distributions, is used to configure the required interface (snbi-fe) and assign the appropriate IPv6 address.
* GRE Tunnel Creation: LinkLocal GRE tunnels are created to each of the discovered devices that are part of the domain. The GRE tunnels are used to create the overlay network for the domain.
* Routing over the Overlay: To enable reachability of devices within the overlay network a light weight routing protocol is used. The routing protocol of choice is the RPL(Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) protocol. The routing protocol advertises the device domain IPv6 address over the overlay network. *Unstrung* is the open source implementation of RPL and is packaged within the docker image.
* IPSEC: Ipsec is used to secure any traffic routed over the tunnels. StrongSwan is used to encrypt traffic using IPSEC.

==== Docker Image

The SNBI Forwarding Element is packaged in a docker container available at this
link: https://hub.docker.com/r/snbi/beryllium/.
For more information on docker, refer to this link:
https://docs.docker.com/linux/.

To update an SNBI FE Daemon, build the image and copy the image to /home/snbi
directory. When the docker image is run, it autoamtically generates a startup
configuration file for the SNBI FE daemon. The startup configuration script is
also available at /home/snbi.

=== Key APIs and Interfaces
The only API that SNBI exposes is to configure the whitelist of devices for a domain.

The POST method below configures a domain - "secure-domain" and configures a whitelist set of devices to be accommodated to the domain.
----
{
  "snbi-domain": {
    "domain-name": "secure-domain",
    "device-list": [
      {
        "list-name": "demo list",
        "list-type": "white",
        "active": true,
        "devices": [
          {
            "device-id": "UDI-FirstFE"
          },
          {
            "device-id": "UDI-dev1"
          },
          {
            "device-id": "UDI-dev2"
          }
        ]
      }
     ]
  }
}
----
The associated device ID must be configured on the SNBI FE (see below).
