== UNI Manager Plug-In Developer Guide

=== Overview
The UNI Manager plug in exposes capabilities of OpenDaylight to configure
networked equipment to operate according to Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF)
requirements for User Network Interface (UNI) and to support the creation of
an Ethernet Virtual Connection (EVC) according to MEF requirements.

UNI Manager adheres to a minimum set of functionality defined by MEF 7.2 and
10.2 specifications.

=== Functionality
The UNI manager plugin enables the creation of Ethernet Virtual Connections (EVC) as defined by the Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF). An EVC provides a simulated Ethernet connection among LANS existing at different geographical locations. This version of the plugin is limited to connecting two LANS.

As defined by MEF, each location to be connected must have a User Network Interface, (UNI) which is a device that connects the user LAN to the EVC providers network.

In Beryllium release, UNI and EVC are implemented via Open_vSwitch, leveraging the OVSDB project: creating a UNI will end up creating an OVSDB node with an _ovsbr0_ bridge, interface and port. While creating a UNI, based on the MEF requirement, one can specify a desired QoS; this leverage the QoS and Queue tables from the OVS database. (see documentation bellow for full details). +
Same goes with the EVC, to which one can apply a given QoS to control the speed of the connection.
Creating an EVC will add two additional ports to the _ovsbr0_ bridge: + 
- _eht0_: the interface connected to a client laptop +
- _gre1_, interface used to for gre tunnelling between two clients (VXLAN).

Finally, within this release, UniMgr is more a Proof Of Concept than a framework to be used in production. Previous demonstration where made using Raspberry Pis, having a low NIC bandwith, thus the speed as defined in the API is actually mapped as follow:

    "speed-10M"  => 1 MB
    "speed-100M" => 2 MB
    "speed-1G"   => 3 MB
    "speed-10G"  => 4 MB

=== UNI Manager REST APIs

This API enables the creation and management of both UNI's and EVCs.  In order to create an EVC using this interface you would first create two UNI's via the following REST API (see documentation below for full details)

    PUT http://<host-ip>:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/unimgr:uni/node/<uni-id>

You would then create an EVC, indicating that it is a connection between the two UNI's that were just created, via the following REST API (see documentation below for full details)

    PUT http://<host-ip>:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/unimgr:evc/link/<evc-id>

You can then change attributes of the UNI's or EVCs, and delete these entities using this API (see documentation below for full details).

This plugin uses the OpenDaylight OVSDB plugin to provision and the manage devices which implement the OVSDB REST interface, as needed to realize the UNI and EVC life-cycles

NOTE: both the configuration and operational databases can be operated upon by the unimgr REST API.  The only difference between the two is in the REST Path. The configuration datastore represents the desired state, the operational datastore represents the actual state.

For operating on the config database
    http://<host-ip>:8181/restconf/config/<PATH>

For operating on the operational database
    http://<host-ip>:8181/restconf/operational/<PATH>
