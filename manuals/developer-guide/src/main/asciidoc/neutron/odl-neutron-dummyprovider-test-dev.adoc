== Neutron dummy provider Developer Guide

=== Overview

Neutron dummy provider provides a dummy provider for Neutron service.
Which consumes legacy Neutron I*Aware interfaces and just return success.
This serves as a obvious sample implementation for provider of Neutron
service, test harness for Neutron Service and also place holder when
openstack provider decides to implement only a part of the services.

=== Neutron dummy provider Architecture

It implements I*Aware interface in trivial way to simply return success
or log when resource deletion.
