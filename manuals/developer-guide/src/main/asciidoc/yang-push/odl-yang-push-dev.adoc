== YANG-PUSH Developer Guide

=== Overview
The YANG PUBSUB project allows subscriptions to be placed on
targeted subtrees of YANG datastores residing on remote devices.
Changes in YANG objects within the remote subtree can be pushed
to an OpenDaylight controller as specified without a requiring
the controller to make a continuous set of fetch requests.

==== YANG-PUSH capabilities available

This module contains the base code which embodies the intent of YANG-PUSH requirements for subscription as defined in {i2rs-pub-sub-requirements} [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-i2rs-pub-sub-requirements/].   The mechanism for delivering on these YANG-PUSH requirements over Netconf transport is defined in {netconf-yang-push} [netconf-yang-push: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-netconf-yang-push-00].  

Note that in the current release, not all capabilities of draft-ietf-netconf-yang-push are realized.   Currently only implemented is *create-subscription* RPC support from ietf-datastore-push@2015-10-15.yang; and this will be for periodic subscriptions only.  There of course is intent to provide much additional functionality in future OpenDaylight releases.

==== Future YANG-PUSH capabilities

Over time, the intent is to flesh out more robust capabilities which will allow OpenDaylight applications to subscribe to YANG-PUSH compliant devices.  Capabilities for future releases will include:

Support for subscription change/delete:
*modify-subscription* rpc support for all mountpoint devices or particular mountpoint device
*delete-subscription* rpc support for all mountpoint devices or particular mountpoint device

Support for static subscriptions:
This will enable the receipt of subscription updates pushed from publishing devices where no signaling from the controller has been used to establish the subscriptions.

Support for additional transports:
NETCONF is not the only transport of interest to OpenDaylight or the subscribed devices.  Over time this code will support Restconf and HTTP/2 transport requirements defined in {netconf-restconf-yang-push} [https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-voit-netconf-restconf-yang-push-01]


=== YANG-PUSH Architecture

The code architecture of Yang push consists of two main elements

YANGPUSH Provider
YANGPUSH Listener

YANGPUSH Provider receives create-subscription requests from applications and then establishes/registers the corresponding listener which will receive information pushed by a publisher.  In addition, YANGPUSH Provider also invokes an augmented OpenDaylight create-subscription RPC which enables applications to register for notification as per rfc5277. This augmentation adds periodic time period (duration) and subscription-id values to the existing RPC parameters. The Java package supporting this capability is “org.opendaylight.yangpush.impl”. Below class supports the YANGPUSH Provider capability:

(1) YangpushDomProvider
The Binding Independent version. It uses a neutral data Document Object Model format for data and API calls, which is independent of any generated Java language bindings from the YANG model.


The YANGPUSH Listener accepts update notifications from a device after they have been de-encapsulated from the NETCONF transport.  The YANGPUSH Listener then passes these updates to MD-SAL.  This function is implemented via the YangpushDOMNotificationListener class within the “org.opendaylight.yangpush.listner” Java package.

=== Key APIs and Interfaces

==== YangpushDomProvider

Central to this is onSessionInitiated  which acquires the Document Object Model format based versions of MD-SAL services, including the MountPoint service and RPCs.  Via these acquired services, invoke registerDataChangeListener over in YangpushDOMNotificationListener.

==== YangpushDOMNotificationListener
This API handles instances of a received Push Updates which are inbound to the listener and places these in MD-SAL.   Key classes in include:

onPushUpdate
Converts and validates the encoding of the pushed subscription update. If the subscription exists and is active, calls updateDataStoreForPushUpdate so that the information can be put in MD-SAL. Finally logs the pushed subscription update as well as some additional context information.

updateDataStoreForPushUpdate
Used to put the published information into MD-SAL.  This pushed information will also include elements such as the subscription-id, the identity of the publisher, the time of the update, the incoming encoding type, and the pushed YANG subtree information.

YangpushDOMNotificationListener
Starts the listener tracking a new Subscription ID from a particular publisher.
