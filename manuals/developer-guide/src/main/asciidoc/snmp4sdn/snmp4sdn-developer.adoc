== SNMP4SDN Developer Guide
=== Overview
We propose a southbound plugin that can control the off-the-shelf commodity Ethernet switches for the purpose of building SDN using Ethernet switches. For Ethernet switches, forwarding table, VLAN table, and ACL are where one can install flow configuration on, and this is done via SNMP and CLI in the proposed plugin. In addition, some settings required for Ethernet switches in SDN, e.g., disabling STP and flooding, are proposed.

=== Architecture
The modules in the plugin are depicted as the following figure.

image::snmp4sdn_modules.jpg["Modules in the SNMP4SDN Plugin",width=400]

* AclService: add/remove ACL profile and rule on the switches.
* FdbService: add/modify/remove FDB table entry on the switches.
* VlanService: add/modify/remove VLAN table entry on the switches.
* TopologyService: query and acquire the subnet topology.
* InventoryService: acquire the switches and their ports.
* DiscoveryService: probe and resolve the underlying switches as well as the port pairs connecting the switches. The probing is realized by SNMP queries. The updates from discovery will also be reflected to the TopologyService.
* MiscConfigService: do kinds of settings on switches
** Supported STP and ARP settings such as enable/disable STP, get port's STP state, get ARP table, set ARP entry, and others
* VendorSpecificHandler: to assist the flow configuration services to call the switch-talking modules with correct parameters value and order.
* Switch-talking modules
** For the services above, when they need to read or configure the underlying switches via SNMP or CLI, these queries are dealt with the modules SNMPHandler and CLIHandler which directly talk with the switches. The SNMPListener is to listen to snmp trap such as link up/down event or switch on/off event.

=== Design
In terms of the architecture of the SNMP4SDN Plugin's features, the features include flow configuration, topology discovery, and multi-vendor support. Their architectures please refer to Wiki (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/SNMP4SDN:Developer_Guide#Design[Developer Guide - Design]).
