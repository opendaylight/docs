=== OVSDB MD-SAL Southbound Plugin Developer Guide

==== Overview
The Open vSwitch Database (OVSDB) Model Driven Service Abstraction Layer
(MD-SAL) Southbound Plugin provides an MD-SAL based interface to
Open vSwitch systems.  This is done by augmenting the MD-SAL topology node with
a YANG model which replicates some (but not all) of the Open vSwitch schema.

==== OVSDB MD-SAL Southbound Plugin Architecture and Operation
The architecture and operation of the OVSDB MD-SAL Southbound plugin is
illustrated in the following set of diagrams.

===== Connecting to an OVSDB Node
An OVSDB node is a system which is running the OVS software and is capable of
being managed by an OVSDB manager.  The OVSDB MD-SAL Southbound plugin in
OpenDaylight is capable of operating as an OVSDB manager.  Depending on the
configuration of the OVSDB node, the connection of the OVSDB manager can
be active or passive.

====== Active OVSDB Node Manager Workflow
An active OVSDB node manager connection is made when OpenDaylight initiates the
connection to the OVSDB node.  In order for this to work, you must configure the
OVSDB node to listen on a TCP port for the connection (i.e.
OpenDaylight is active and the OVSDB node is passive).  This option can be
configured on the OVSDB node using the following command:

 ovs-vsctl set-manager ptcp:6640

The following diagram illustrates the sequence of events which occur when
OpenDaylight initiates an active OVSDB manager connection to an OVSDB node.

.Active OVSDB Manager Connection

Step 1::
Create an OVSDB node by using RESTCONF or an OpenDaylight plugin. The OVSDB node
is listed under the OVSDB topology node.
Step 2::
Add the OVSDB node to the OVSDB MD-SAL southbound configuration datastore. The
OVSDB southbound provider is registered to listen for data change events on the
portion of the MD-SAL topology data store which contains the OVSDB southbound
topology node augmentations. The addition of an OVSDB node causes an event which
is received by the OVSDB Southbound provider.
Step 3::
The OVSDB Southbound provider initiates a connection to the OVSDB node using
the connection information provided in the configuration OVSDB node (i.e. IP
address and TCP port number).
Step 4::
The OVSDB Southbound provider adds the OVSDB node to the OVSDB MD-SAL
operational data store.  The operational data store contains OVSDB node
objects which represent active connections to OVSDB nodes.
Step 5::
The OVSDB Southbound provider requests the schema and databases which are
supported by the OVSDB node.
Step 6::
The OVSDB Southbound provider uses the database and schema information to
construct a monitor request which causes the OVSDB node to send the controller
any updates made to the OVSDB databases on the OVSDB node.


====== Passive OVSDB Node Manager Workflow
A passive OVSDB node connection to OpenDaylight is made when the OVSDB node
initiates the connection to OpenDaylight.  In order for this to work, you must
configure the OVSDB node to connect to the IP address and OVSDB port on which
OpenDaylight is listening.  This option can be configured on the OVSDB node
using the following command:

 ovs-vsctl set-manager tcp:<IP address>:6640

The following diagram illustrates the sequence of events which occur when an
OVSDB node connects to OpenDaylight.

.Passive OVSDB Manager Connection
image::ovsdb-sb-passive-connection.jpg[width=500]

Step 1::
The OVSDB node initiates a connection to OpenDaylight.
Step 2::
The OVSDB Southbound provider adds the OVSDB node to the OVSDB MD-SAL
operational data store.  The operational data store contains OVSDB node
objects which represent active connections to OVSDB nodes.
Step 3::
The OVSDB Southbound provider requests the schema and databases which are
supported by the OVSDB node.
Step 4::
The OVSDB Southbound provider uses the database and schema information to
construct a monitor request which causes the OVSDB node to send back
any updates which have been made to the OVSDB databases on the OVSDB node.

===== OVSDB Node ID in the Southbound Operational MD-SAL
When OpenDaylight initiates an active connection to an OVSDB node, it
writes an external-id to the Open_vSwitch table on the OVSDB node.  The
external-id is an OpenDaylight instance identifier which identifies the
OVSDB topology node which has just been created.
Here is an example showing the value of the 'opendaylight-iid' entry
in the external-ids column of the Open_vSwitch table where the
node-id of the OVSDB node is 'ovsdb:HOST1'.

 $ ovs-vsctl list open_vswitch
 ...
 external_ids        : {opendaylight-iid="/network-topology:network-topology/network-topology:topology[network-topology:topology-id='ovsdb:1']/network-topology:node[network-topology:node-id='ovsdb:HOST1']"}
 ...

The 'opendaylight-iid' entry in the external-ids column of the Open_vSwitch
table causes the OVSDB node to have same node-id in the operational
MD-SAL datastore as in the configuration MD-SAL datastore.  This holds true
if the OVSDB node manager settings are subsequently changed so that a
passive OVSDB manager connection is made.

If there is no 'opendaylight-iid' entry in the external-ids column and
a passive OVSDB manager connection is made, then the node-id of the OVSDB
node in the operational MD-SAL datastore will be constructed using the UUID
of the Open_vSwitch table as follows.

 "node-id": "ovsdb://uuid/b8dc0bfb-d22b-4938-a2e8-b0084d7bd8c1"
 
The 'opendaylight-iid' entry can be removed from the Open_vSwitch table using
the following command.

 $ sudo ovs-vsctl remove open_vswitch . external-id "opendaylight-iid"

===== OVSDB Changes by using OVSDB Southbound Config MD-SAL
After the connection has been made to an OVSDB node, you can make changes to the
OVSDB node by using the OVSDB Southbound Config MD-SAL.  You can
make CRUD operations by using the RESTCONF interface or by a plugin
using the MD-SAL APIs.  The following diagram illustrates the high-level flow of
events.

.OVSDB Changes by using the Southbound Config MD-SAL
image::ovsdb-sb-config-crud.jpg[width=500]

Step 1::
A change to the OVSDB Southbound Config MD-SAL is made.  Changes include adding
or deleting bridges and ports, or setting attributes of OVSDB nodes, bridges or
ports.
Step 2::
The OVSDB Southbound provider receives notification of the changes made to the
OVSDB Southbound Config MD-SAL data store.
Step 3::
As appropriate, OVSDB transactions are constructed and transmitted to the OVSDB
node to update the OVSDB database on the OVSDB node.
Step 4::
The OVSDB node sends update messages to the OVSDB Southbound provider to
indicate the changes made to the OVSDB nodes database.
Step 5::
The OVSDB Southbound provider maps the changes received from the OVSDB node
into corresponding changes made to the OVSDB Southbound Operational
MD-SAL data store.

===== Detecting changes in OVSDB coming from outside OpenDaylight
Changes to the OVSDB nodes database may also occur independently of OpenDaylight.
OpenDaylight also receives notifications for these events and updates the
Southbound operational MD-SAL.  The following diagram illustrates the sequence
of events.

.OVSDB Changes made directly on the OVSDB node
image::ovsdb-sb-oper-crud.jpg[width=500]

Step 1::
Changes are made to the OVSDB node outside of OpenDaylight (e.g. ovs-vsctl).
Step 2::
The OVSDB node constructs update messages to inform OpenDaylight of the changes
made to its databases.
Step 3::
The OVSDB Southbound provider maps the OVSDB database changes to corresponding
changes in the OVSDB Southbound operational MD-SAL data store.

===== OVSDB Model
The OVSDB Southbound MD-SAL operates using a YANG model which is based on the
abstract topology node model found in the 
https://github.com/opendaylight/yangtools/blob/stable/lithium/model/ietf/ietf-topology/src/main/yang/network-topology%402013-10-21.yang[network topology model].

The augmentations for the OVSDB Southbound MD-SAL are defined in the
https://github.com/opendaylight/ovsdb/blob/stable/lithium/southbound/southbound-api/src/main/yang/ovsdb.yang[ovsdb.yang] file.

There are three augmentations:

*ovsdb-node-augmentation*::
This augments the topology node and maps primarily to the Open_vSwitch table of
the OVSDB schema.  It contains the following attributes.
  * *connection-info* - holds the local and remote IP address and TCP port numbers for the OpenDaylight to OVSDB node connections
  * *db-version* - version of the OVSDB database
  * *ovs-version* - version of OVS
  * *list managed-node-entry* - a list of references to ovsdb-bridge-augmentation nodes, which are the OVS bridges managed by this OVSDB node
  * *list datapath-type-entry* - a list of the datapath types supported by the OVSDB node (e.g. 'system', 'netdev') - depends on newer OVS versions
  * *list interface-type-entry* - a list of the interface types supported by the OVSDB node (e.g. 'internal', 'vxlan', 'gre', 'dpdk', etc.) - depends on newer OVS verions
  * *list openvswitch-external-ids* - a list of the key/value pairs in the Open_vSwitch table external_ids column
  * *list openvswitch-other-config* - a list of the key/value pairs in the Open_vSwitch table other_config column
*ovsdb-bridge-augmentation*::
This augments the topology node and maps to an specific bridge in the OVSDB
bridge table of the associated OVSDB node. It contains the following attributes.
  * *bridge-uuid* - UUID of the OVSDB bridge
  * *bridge-name* - name of the OVSDB bridge
  * *bridge-openflow-node-ref* - a reference (instance-identifier) of the OpenFlow node associated with this bridge
  * *list protocol-entry* - the version of OpenFlow protocol to use with the OpenFlow controller
  * *list controller-entry* - a list of controller-uuid and is-connected status of the OpenFlow controllers associated with this bridge
  * *datapath-id* - the datapath ID associated with this bridge on the OVSDB node
  * *datapath-type* - the datapath type of this bridge
  * *fail-mode* - the OVSDB fail mode setting of this bridge
  * *flow-node* - a reference to the flow node corresponding to this bridge
  * *managed-by* - a reference to the ovsdb-node-augmentation (OVSDB node) that is managing this bridge
  * *list bridge-external-ids* - a list of the key/value pairs in the bridge table external_ids column for this bridge
  * *list bridge-other-configs* - a list of the key/value pairs in the bridge table other_config column for this bridge
*ovsdb-termination-point-augmentation*::
This augments the topology termination point model.  The OVSDB Southbound
MD-SAL uses this model to represent both the OVSDB port and OVSDB interface for
a given port/interface in the OVSDB schema.  It contains the following
attributes.
  * *port-uuid* - UUID of an OVSDB port row
  * *interface-uuid* - UUID of an OVSDB interface row
  * *name* - name of the port
  * *interface-type* - the interface type
  * *list options* - a list of port options
  * *ofport* - the OpenFlow port number of the interface
  * *ofport_request* - the requested OpenFlow port number for the interface
  * *vlan-tag* - the VLAN tag value
  * *list trunks* - list of VLAN tag values for trunk mode
  * *vlan-mode* - the VLAN mode (e.g. access, native-tagged, native-untagged, trunk)
  * *list port-external-ids* - a list of the key/value pairs in the port table external_ids column for this port
  * *list interface-external-ids* - a list of the key/value pairs in the interface table external_ids interface for this interface
  * *list port-other-configs* - a list of the key/value pairs in the port table other_config column for this port
  * *list interface-other-configs* - a list of the key/value pairs in the interface table other_config column for this interface

==== Examples of OVSDB Southbound MD-SAL API

===== Connect to an OVSDB Node
This example RESTCONF command adds an OVSDB node object to the OVSDB
Southbound configuration data store and attempts to connect to the OVSDB host
located at the IP address 10.11.12.1 on TCP port 6640.

 POST http://<host>:8181/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/ovsdb:1/
 Content-Type: application/json
 {
   "node": [
      {
        "node-id": "ovsdb:HOST1",
        "connection-info": {
          "ovsdb:remote-ip": "10.11.12.1",
          "ovsdb:remote-port": 6640
        }
      }
   ]
 }

===== Query the OVSDB Southbound Configuration MD-SAL
Following on from the previous example, if the OVSDB Southbound configuration
MD-SAL is queried, the RESTCONF command and the resulting reply is similar
to the following example.

 GET http://<host>:8080/restconf/config/network-topology:network-topology/topology/ovsdb:1/
 Application/json data in the reply
 {
   "topology": [
     {
       "topology-id": "ovsdb:1",
       "node": [
         {
           "node-id": "ovsdb:HOST1",
           "ovsdb:connection-info": {
             "remote-port": 6640,
             "remote-ip": "10.11.12.1"
           }
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
 }

// ==== Query the OVSDB Southbound Operational MD-SAL
// If the previous example POST command is successful in connecting to the OVSDB
// node, then eventually the OVSDB Southbound operational MD-SAL is populated
// with information received in an OVSDB update message from the OVSDB node.  The
// RESTCONF query and resulting reply is similar to the following example.
// 
//  http://<host>:8080/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/ovsdb:1/
// 
//  Application/json data in the reply
//  TBD - things not working well at time of writing
// 
// 
// 
// ==== Add a bridge
// TBD
// 
// ==== Add a port
// TBD
// 
// ==== Set attributes
// TBD
