== OVSDB Openstack Developer Guide

=== Overview
The Open vSwitch database (OVSDB) Plugin component for OpenDaylight implements
the OVSDB  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047[RFC 7047] management protocol
that allows the southbound configuration of switches that support OVSDB.The
component comprises a library and a plugin usages. The OVSDB protocol
uses JSON-RPC calls to manipulate a physical or virtual switch that supports OVSDB. 
Many vendors support OVSDB on various hardware platforms.
The OpenDaylight controller uses the library project to interact with an OVS
instance.

http://www.openstack.org[OpenStack] is a popular open source infrastructure
as a service project, covering compute, storage and network management.
OpenStack can use OpenDaylight as its network management provider through the
Neutron API, which acts as a northbound for OpenStack. The providers for
the Neutron API are in the OVSDB Net-virt piece of OVSDB.
OpenDaylight manages the network flows for the OpenStack compute nodes via
the OVSDB project, with the south-bound plugin. This section describes how to
set that up, and how to tell when everything is working.

=== OVSDB Openstack Architecture
The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies: +
