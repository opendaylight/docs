=== OVSDB Openstack Developer Guide

==== Overview
The Open vSwitch database (OVSDB) Southbound Plugin component for OpenDaylight implements
the OVSDB  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047[RFC 7047] management protocol
that allows the southbound configuration of switches that support OVSDB. The
component comprises a library and a plugin. The OVSDB protocol
uses JSON-RPC calls to manipulate a physical or virtual switch that supports OVSDB.
Many vendors support OVSDB on various hardware platforms.
The OpenDaylight controller uses the library project to interact with an OVS
instance.

http://www.openstack.org[OpenStack] is a popular open source Infrastructure
as a Service (IaaS) project, covering compute, storage and network management.
OpenStack can use OpenDaylight as its network management provider through the
Neutron API, which acts as a northbound for OpenStack. the OVSDB NetVirt piece
of the OVSDB project is a provider for the Neutron API in OpenDaylight.
OpenDaylight manages the network flows for the OpenStack compute nodes via
the OVSDB project, with the south-bound plugin. This section describes how to
set that up, and how to tell when everything is working.

==== OVSDB Openstack Architecture
The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies:

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047[RFC 7047] - The Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol
