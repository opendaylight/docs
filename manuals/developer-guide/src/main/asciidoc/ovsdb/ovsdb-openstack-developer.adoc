== OVSDB Openstack Developer Guide

=== Overview
The Open vSwitch database (OVSDB) Plugin component for OpenDaylight implements
the OVSDB  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047[RFC 7047] management protocol
that allows the southbound configuration of vSwitches. The component comprises
a library and various plugin usages. The OVSDB protocol uses JSON/RPC calls
to manipulate a physical or virtual switch that has OVSDB attached to it.
Almost all vendors support OVSDB on various hardware platforms. The OpenDaylight
controller uses the native OVSDB implementation to manipulate the Open vSwitch
database.

http://www.openstack.org[OpenStack] is a popular open source Infrastructure
as a service project, covering compute, storage and network management.
OpenStack can use OpenDaylight as its network management provider through the
Modular Layer 2 (ML2) north-bound plug-in. OpenDaylight manages the network
flows for the OpenStack compute nodes via the OVSDB south-bound plug-in. This
page describes how to set that up, and how to tell when everything is working.

=== OVSDB Openstack Architecture
The OpenStack integration architecture uses the following technologies: +

* https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047[RFC 7047] and http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7047/[The Open vSwitch Database Management Protocol]
* OpenFlow v1.3
* OpenStack Neutron ML2 Plugin
