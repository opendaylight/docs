== OVSDB Northbound Developer Guide

=== Overview
The OVSDB Northbound feature's goal is to give low level access to
an OVS instance. For instance, one would like to be able to crud
rows directly into the OVS instance by using RESTConf. The intent
here is to provide the same api that was provided before with the
older northbound module but within RESTConf.

The target audience for this feature is one that need low level
access to an OVS instance while needing to use Opendaylight as a whole.

=== OVSDB Northbound Developer Architecture
The northbound bundle architecture is as follow:

- mdsal-northbound-aggregator

- mdsal-northbound-api

- mdsal-northbound-impl

- mdsal-northbound-config

- mdsal-northbound-features
