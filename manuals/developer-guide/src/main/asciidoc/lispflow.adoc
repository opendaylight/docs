=== OpenDaylight Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) Flow Mapping Overview

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830[Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)] is a technology that provides a flexible map-and-encap framework that can be used for overlay network applications such as data center network virtualization and Network Function Virtualization (NFV).

LISP provides the following name spaces: 

* http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#page-6[Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)]
* http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-3[Routing Locators (RLOCs)]

In a virtualization environment EIDs can be viewed as virtual address space and RLOCs can be viewed as physical network address space. 

The LISP framework decouples network control plane from the forwarding plane by providing: 

* A data plane that specifies how the virtualized network addresses are encapsulated in addresses from the underlying physical network.
*  A control plane that stores the mapping of the virtual-to-physical address spaces and the associated forwarding policies and serves this information to the data plane on demand. 

Network programmability is achieved by programming forwarding policies such as transparent mobility, service chaining, and traffic engineering in the mapping system; where the data plane elements can fetch these policies on demand as new flows arrive. This chapter describes the LISP Flow Mapping project in OpenDaylight and how it can be used to enable advanced SDN and NFV use cases. 

LISP data plane Tunnel Routers are available at http://LISPmob.org/[LISPmob.org] in the open source community on the following platforms: 

* Linux 
* Android 
* OpenWRT 

For more details and support for LISP data plane software please visit http://LISPmob.org/[the LISPmob web site].

=== LISP Flow Mapping Service

The LISP Flow Mapping service provides LISP Mapping System services. This includes LISP  Map-Server and LISP Map-Resolver services to store and serve mapping data to data plane nodes as well as to OpenDaylight applications. Mapping data can include mapping of virtual addresses to physical network address where the virtual nodes are reachable or hosted at. Mapping data can also include a variety of routing policies including traffic engineering and load balancing. To leverage this service, OpenDaylight applications and services can use the northbound REST API to define the mappings and policies in the LISP Mapping Service. Data plane devices capable of LISP control protocol can leverage this service through a southbound LISP plugin via the LISP control protocol (Map-Register, Map-Request, Map-Reply messages). 

The following figure depicts the described components:

=== LISP Service Architecture

The following figure shows the various LISP Flow Mapping modules. 

.LISP Mapping Service Internal Architecture

image::lispflow-technical-arch-overview-helium.jpg["LISP Mapping Service Internal Architecture", width=460]

A brief description of each module is as follows:

* *DAO:* This layer separates the LISP logic from the database, so that we can separate the map server and map resolver from the specific implementation of the DHT (Distributed Hash Table). Currently we have an implementation of this layer with the controller cluster service as a DHT, but it can be switched to any other DHT and you only need to implement the ILISPDAO interface.
* *Map Server:* This module processes the adding or registration of keys and mappings. For a detailed specification of LISP Map Server, see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* *Map Resolver:* This module receives and processes the mapping lookup queries and provides the mappings to requester. For a detailed specification of LISP Map Server, see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* *Northbound API:* This is part of the ODL northbound API. This module enables defining key-EID associations as well as adding mapping information through the Map Server. Key-EID associations can also be queried via this API. The Northbound API also provides capability of querying the mapping information for an EID prefix.
* *Neutron:* This module implements the ODL Neutron Service APIs. It provides integration between the LISP service and the ODL Neutron service.
* *NETCONF:* This module enables the LISP service to communicate to NETCONF-enabled devices through ODL's NETCONF plugin.
* *Java API:* The API module exposes the Map Server and Map Resolver capabilities via Java API.
* *LISP Southbound Plugin:* This plugin enables data plane devices that support LISP control plane protocol (see LISP) to register and query mappings to the LISP Flow Mapping via the LISP control plane protocol.

=== LISP APIs

The LISP Flow Mapping service has JAVA APIs and REST APIs. The Java API reference documentation is auto-generated from the Java build and is available at:

* https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/lispflowmapping/job/lispflowmapping-merge-develop/247/artifact/target/apidocs/index.html[JAVA APIs]

Below you will find the detailed information about the module's REST resources and their verbs (description, URI, parameters, responses, and status codes), schemas, example XML, example JSON, as well as programming examples.

* https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/lispflowmapping/job/lispflowmapping-merge-develop/247/artifact/mappingservice/northbound/target/site/wsdocs/index.html[REST APIS]

//TODO Need to update the links once the stable/helium branch is cut and the corresponding Jenkins merge job is created.  For now, instead of 'lastSuccessfulBuild' let's use the merge job corresponding to the commit that's supposed to be released as Helium

=== LISP Configuration Options

The +etc/custom.properties+ file in the Karaf distribution allows configuration of several OpenDaylight parameters.  The LISP service has two properties that can be adjusted: +lisp.mappingOverwrite+ and +lisp.smr+.

*lisp.mappingOverwrite* (default: 'true')::
    Configures handling of mapping updates.  When set to 'true' (default) a mapping update (either through the southbound plugin via a Map-Register message or through a northbound API PUT REST call) the existing RLOC set associated to an EID prefix is overwritten.  When set to 'false', the RLOCs of the update are merged to the existing set.

*lisp.smr* (default: 'false')::
    Enables/disables the http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-6.6.2[Solicit-Map-Request (SMR)] functionality.  SMR is a method to notify changes in an EID-to-RLOC mapping to "subscribers".  The LISP service considers all Map-Request's source RLOC as a subscriber to the requested EID prefix, and will send an SMR control message to that RLOC if the mapping changes.

=== Developer Tutorial

This section provides instructions to set up a LISP network of three nodes (one "client" node and two "server" nodes) using LISPmob and Open vSwitch (OVS) as data plane LISP nodes and the LISP Flow Mapping project from ODL as the LISP programmable mapping system for the LISP network. The steps shown below will demonstrate performing a failover between the two "server" nodes. The three LISP data plane nodes and the LISP mapping system are assumed to be running in Linux virtual machines using the following IPv4 addresses on their eth0 interfaces (please adjust configuration files, JSON examples, etc. accordingly if you're using another addressing scheme):

.Nodes in the tutorial
[align="right",options="header"]
|===
| Node          |  Node Type     | IP Address
| *controller*  |  OpenDaylight  | 10.33.12.32
| *client*      |  LISPmob       | 10.33.12.35
| *server1*     |  LISPmob       | 10.33.12.37
| *server2*     |  Open vSwitch  | 10.33.12.44
|===

NOTE: While the tutorial uses LISPmob and OVS as the data plane, they could be any LISP-enabled HW or SW router (commercial/open source).

The below steps are using the command line tool cURL to talk to the LISP Flow Mapping northbound REST API. This is so that you can see the actual request URLs and body content on the page. 

NOTE: It is more convenient to use the Postman Chrome browser plugin to edit and send the requests. The project git repository hosts a collection of the requests that are used in this tutorial in the +resources/tutorial/ODL_Summit_LISP_Demo.json+ file. You can import this file to Postman by following 'Collections->Import a collection->Import from URL' and then entering the following link: +https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/ODL_Summit_LISP_Demo.json;hb=refs/heads/develop+. Alternatively, you can save the file on your machine, or if you have the repository checked out, you can import from there. You will need to define some variables to point to your OpenDaylight controller instance.

NOTE: It is assumed that commands are executed as the 'root' user. 

NOTE: To set up a basic LISP network overlay (no fail-over) without dealing with OVS, you can skip steps 7 and 8 and just use LISPmob as your dataplane. If you do want to test fail-over, but not using OVS, skip steps 7 and 8, but set up LISPmob on *server2* as well, with identical configuration.

. Install and run OpenDaylight Helium release on the controller VM. Please follow the general OpenDaylight Helium Installation Guide for this step. Once the OpenDaylight controller is running install the 'odl-openflowplugin-all', 'odl-adsal-compatibility-all', 'odl-ovsdb-all', and 'odl-lispflowmapping-all' features from the CLI:

 feature:install odl-openflowplugin-all odl-adsal-compatibility-all odl-ovsdb-all odl-lispflowmapping-all
+
NOTE: If you're not planning on using OVS you can skip the first three and install 'odl-lispflowmapping-all' only.
+
It takes quite a while to load and initialize all features and their dependencies. It's worth running the command +log:tail+ in the Karaf console to see when is the log output winding down, and continue after that.
    
. Install LISPmob on the *client* and *server1* VMs following the installation instructions https://github.com/LISPmob/lispmob#software-prerequisites[from the LISPmob README file].

. Configure the LISPmob installations from the previous step. Starting from the +lispd.conf.example+ file in the distribution, set the EID in each +lispd.conf+ file from the IP address space selected for your virtual/LISP network. In this tutorial the EID of the *client* is set to 1.1.1.1/32, and that of *server1* to 2.2.2.2/32. Set the RLOC interface in each +lispd.conf+. LISP will determine the RLOC (IP address of the corresponding VM) based on this interface. Set the Map-Resolver address to the IP address of the *controller*, and on the *client* the Map-Server too. On *server1* set the Map-Server to something else, so that it doesn't interfere with the mappings on the controller, since we're going to program them manually. Modify the "key" parameter in each +lispd.conf+ file to a key/password of your choice, 'asdf' in this tutorial. The +resources/tutorial+ directory in the 'develop' branch of the project git repository has the files used in the tutorial checked in: https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/lispd.conf.client;hb=refs/heads/develop[lispd.conf.client] and https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/lispd.conf.server1;hb=refs/heads/develop[lispd.conf.server1]. Copy the files to +/root/lispd.conf+ on the respective VMs.

. Define a key and EID prefix association in ODL using the northbound API for both EIDs (1.1.1.1/32 and 2.2.2.2/32).  Run the below commands on the *controller* (or any machine that can reach *controller*, by replacing 'localhost' with the IP address of *controller*).

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key \
     --data @key1.json
 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key \
     --data @key2.json

+
where the content of the 'key1.json' and 'key2.json' files is the following (with different "ipAddress"):
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "key" : "asdf",
  "maskLength" : 32,
  "address" :
  {
    "ipAddress" : "1.1.1.1",
    "afi" : 1
  }
}
----

. Verify that the key is added properly by requesting the following URL:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key/0/1/1.1.1.1/32
 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key/0/1/2.2.2.2/32

. Run the lispd LISPmob daemon on the *client* and *server1* VMs:

 lispd -f /root/lispd.conf

. Prepare the OVS environment on *server2*:

 .. Start the ovsdb-server and ovs-vswitchd daemons (or check that your distribution's init scripts already started them)
 .. Start listening for OVSDB manager connections on the standard 6640 TCP port:

 ovs-vsctl set-manager "ptcp:6640"
 ovs-vsctl show

+
 .. Create a TAP port for communications with the guest VM.  We'll have another VM inside the *server2* VM, that will be set up with the 2.2.2.2/24 EID.  It also needs a ficticious gateway, and a static ARP entry for that gateway, with any MAC address.

 tunctl -t tap0
 ifconfig tap0 up

+
 .. Start the guest VM:

 modprobe kvm
 kvm -daemonize -vnc :0 -m 128 -net nic,macaddr=00:00:0C:15:C0:A1 \
     -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
     -drive file=ubuntu.12-04.x86-64.20120425.static_ip_2.2.2.2.qcow2

+
. Set up the OVS environment on *server2* using the ODL northbound API
 .. Connect to the OVSDB management port from ODL:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/connectionmanager/node/server2/address/10.33.12.44/port/6640

+
You can check if this and the next requests have the desired effect on OVS by running the following on *server2*

 ovs-vsctl show

+
It should now show the "Manager" connection as connected

 .. Create the bridge +br0+:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/networkconfig/bridgedomain/bridge/OVS/server2/br0 -d "{}"

 .. Add +tap0+ to +br0+:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/networkconfig/bridgedomain/port/OVS/server2/br0/tap0 -d "{}"

+
 .. Add the +lisp0+ LISP tunneling virtual port to +br0+:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/networkconfig/bridgedomain/port/OVS/server2/br0/lisp0 -d @lisp0.json
+
where 'lisp0.json' has the following content:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "tunnel",
  "tunnel_type": "lisp",
  "dest_ip": "10.33.12.35"
}
----
The *dest_ip* parameter sets the tunnel destination to the *client* VM. This has to be done manually (from the controller), since OVS doesn't have a LISP control plane to fetch mappings.

 .. We will now need to set up flows on +br0+ to to steer traffic received on the LISP virtual port in OVS to the VM connected to +tap0+ and vice-versa. For that we will need the node id of the bridge, which is based on its MAC address, which is generated at creation time. So we look at the list of connections on the controller:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/connectionmanager/nodes
+
The response should look similar to this:
+
[literal]
{"id":"00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44","type":"OF"}]},{"id":"10.33.12.35","type":"LISP"},{"id":"server2","type":"OVS"}]}
+
There are three types of nodes connected to ODL: one "OF" node (the OpenFlow connection to +br0+ on *server2*), one "LISP" node (the *client* VM sending LISP Map-Register control messages to the controller which is acting as a LISP Map-Server), and one "OVS" node (this is the OVSDB connection to *server2*). We will need the id of the "OF" node in order to set up flows.

 .. The first flow will decapsulate traffic received from the client VM on *server2* and send it to the guest VM through the +tap0+ port.

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/flowprogrammer/default/node/OF/00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44/staticFlow/Decap -d @flow_decap.json
+
Make sure that the bridge id after the OF path component of the URL is the id from the previous step. It should also be the same on line 6 in 'flow_decap.json' file (see below), which should have the MAC address of the KVM instance started on *server2* on line 11 (+SET_DL_DST+):
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "installInHw": "true",
  "name": "Decap",
  "node": {
    "type": "OF",
    "id": "00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44"
  },
  "priority": "10",
  "dlDst": "02:00:00:00:00:00",
  "actions": [
    "SET_DL_DST=00:00:0c:15:c0:a1",
    "OUTPUT=1"
  ]
}
----

 .. The second flow will encapsulate traffic received from the guest VM on *server2* through the +tap0+ port.

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/flowprogrammer/default/node/OF/00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44/staticFlow/Encap -d @flow_encap.json
+
The 'flow_encap.json' file should look like this:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "installInHw": "true",
  "name": "Decap",
  "node": {
    "type": "OF",
    "id": "00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44"
  },
  "priority": "5",
  "ingressPort": "1",
  "etherType": "0x0800",
  "vlanId": "0",
  "nwDst": "1.1.1.1/32",
  "actions": [
    "OUTPUT=2"
  ]
}
----

 .. Check if the flows have been created correctly. First, in ODL

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/flowprogrammer/default
+
And most importantly, on *server2*

 ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O OpenFlow13

. The *client* LISPmob node should now register its EID-to-RLOC mapping in ODL. To verify you can lookup the corresponding EIDs via the northbound API

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/mapping/0/1/1.1.1.1/32

 . Register the EID-to-RLOC mapping of the server EID 2.2.2.2/32 to the controller, pointing to *server1* and *server2* with a higher priority for *server1*

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/mapping \
     -d @mapping.json
+
where the 'mapping.json' file looks like this
+
[source,json]
----
{
"key" : "asdf",
"mapregister" :
  {
  "proxyMapReply" : true,
  "eidToLocatorRecords" :
    [
      {
      "authoritative" : true,
      "prefixGeneric" :
        {
        "ipAddress" : "2.2.2.2",
        "afi" : 1
        },
      "mapVersion" : 0,
      "maskLength" : 32,
      "action" : "NoAction",
      "locators" :
        [
          {
          "multicastPriority" : 1,
          "locatorGeneric" :
            {
            "ipAddress" : "10.33.12.37",
            "afi" : 1
            },
          "routed" : true,
          "multicastWeight" : 0,
          "rlocProbed" : false,
          "localLocator" : false,
          "priority" : 126,
          "weight" : 1
          } ,
          {
          "multicastPriority" : 1,
          "locatorGeneric" :
            {
            "ipAddress" : "10.33.12.44",
            "afi" : 1
            },
          "routed" : true,
          "multicastWeight" : 0,
          "rlocProbed" : false,
          "localLocator" : false,
          "priority" : 127,
          "weight" : 1
          }
        ],
      "recordTtl" : 5
      }
    ],
  "keyId" : 0
  }
}
----
+
Here the priority of the second RLOC (10.33.12.44 - *server2*) is 127, a higher numeric value than the priority of 10.33.12.37, which is 126. This policy is saying that *server1* is preferred to *server2* for reaching EID 2.2.2.2/32. Note that lower priority has higher preference in LISP.

 . Verify the correct registration of the 2.2.2.2/32 EID:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/mapping/0/1/2.2.2.2/32

 . Now the LISP network is up. To verify, log into the *client* VM and ping the server EID:

 ping 2.2.2.2

 . Let's test fail-over now. Suppose you had a service on *server1* which became unavailable, but *server1* itself is still reachable. LISP will not automatically fail over, even if the mapping for 2.2.2.2/32 has two locators, since both locators are still reachable and uses the one with the higher priority (lowest priority value). To force a failover, we need to set the priority of *server2* to a lower value. Using the file mapping.json above, swap the priority values between the two locators and repeat the request from step 10. You can also repeat step 11 to see if the mapping is correctly registered. Not that the previous locators are still present, so you should see a list of four locators. If you leave the ping on, and monitor the traffic using wireshark you can see that the ping traffic will be diverted from *server1* to *server2*.
+
With the default ODL configuration this may take some time, because the mapping stays in the *client* map-cache until the TTL expires. LISP has a http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-6.6.2[Solicit-Map-Request (SMR) mechanism] that can ask a LISP data plane element to update its mapping for a certain EID. This is disabled by default, and is controlled by the +lisp.smr+ variable in +etc/custom.porperties+. When enabled, any mapping change from the northbound will trigger an SMR packet to all data plane elements that have requested the mapping in a certain time window.

If you used the Postman collection, you will notice an "ELP" mapping. This is for supporting service chaining, but it requires a Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR). Support for RTR functionality in LISPmob is in progress, and we will update the tutorial to demonstrate service chaining when it becomes available.

=== Installing LISP Flow Mapping

This chapter contains installation instructions for Locator ID Separation Protocol (LISP) provides guidelines for installation from the lispflowmapping repository.

==== Setting up Gerritt

Code reviews are enabled through Gerrit. For setting up gerritt, see https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Gerrit_Setup[Set up Gerrit]. 
>>>>>>> a8dd6f1... added installation section into the lisp doc

NOTE: You will need to perform the Gerrit Setup before you can access git via ssh as described below. 

==== Pulling code via Git CLI

Pull the code by cloning the LispFlowMapping repository. 

----
 git clone ssh://<username>@git.opendaylight.org:29418/lispflowmapping.git
----

or if you just want to do an anonymous git clone, you can use: 

----
 git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/p/lispflowmapping.git
----

==== Setting up Gerrit Change-id Commit Message Hook 

This command inserts a unique Change-Id tag in the footer of a commit message. This step is optional but highly recommended for tracking changes. 

----
 cd lispflowmapping
 scp -p -P 29418 <username>@git.opendaylight.org:hooks/commit-msg .git/hooks/
 chmod 755 .git/hooks/commit-msg
----

Install and setup gitreview. The instaructions can be found at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Gerrit/git-review#Installation%7Chere[here].

==== Hacking the Code 

The following tasks are used to help you hack the code. 

*Setup Eclipse*

. Run Eclipse (Kepler is the current version).
. Open Git Repository perspective.
. Add an existing repository and choose the Lisp Flow Mapping repository that was pulled earlier.
. Import existing Maven projects and choose the following under the lispflowmapping directory:

    * api/pom.xl
    * implementation/pom.xml
	
*Build the code*

----
 mvn clean install
----

To run without unitests you can skip building those tests running the following: 

----
 mvn clean install -DskipTests
 /* instead of "mvn clean install" */
----

*Run the controller*

----
 cd distribution-karaf/target/assembly/bin
 ./karaf
----

At this point the ODL controller is running. Open a web browser and point your browser at http://localhost:8080/ 

For complete documentation on running the controller, see the ODL Helium Installation Guide.

        (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
            of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
            license and I have the right under that license to submit that
            work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
            by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
            permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
            in the file; or

        (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
            person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
            it.

        (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
            are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
            personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
            maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
            this project or the open source license(s) involved.
