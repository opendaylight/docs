== Table Type Patterns

IMPORTANT: This section assumes you have already downloaded the Karaf
           distribution of OpenDaylight Helium and followed the
           instructions in the Table Type Patterns section of the
           Installation guide. If not, do that first.

=== Introduction

Table Type Patterns are a specification developed by the
https://www.opennetworking.org/[Open Networking Foundation] to enable
the description and negotiation of subsets of the OpenFlow protocol.
This is particularly useful for hardware switches that support OpenFlow
as it enables the to describe what features they do (and thus also what
features they do not) support. More details can be found in the full
specification listed on the
https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow[OpenFlow
specifications page].

// it renders it as a link to a file ignoring the https part

==== Support in Helium
In the Helium release, Table Type Patterns (TTPs) are exposed as a YANG
model for TTPs themselves which can be loaded into the MD-SAL Data
Store in three places:
// link to the MD-SAL Data Store docs?

. As one of a list of TTPs in the +opendaylight-ttps+ top-level
  container.
. Attached to a +node+ in the +opendaylight-inventory+ model as an
  +active_ttp+ via the +ttp-capable-node+ augmentation.
. Attached to a +node+ in the +opendaylight-inventory+ model as one of
  a list of +supported_ttps+ via the +ttp-capable-node+ augmentation.
// link to the inventory docs somehow?

Each of these points can be accessed either through the RESTCONF-based
REST APIs or via the Java interface to the MD-SAL Data Store. This
discussion will focus on the REST APIs.

[NOTE]
===============================
Developers who wish to use the Java interfaces are encouraged to to
first read and understand using the MD-SAL Data Store's APIs including
importing the appropriate bundles for to get models, dealing with
transactions, and constructing instance identifiers.

After that, it should be somewhat straightforward to translate the REST
API calls here into appropriate instance identifiers which can be used
in MD-SAL Data Store transactions.
===============================

=== Using The REST APIs

As stated above there are 3 locations where a Table Type Patter can be
placed into the MD-SAL Data Store. They correspond to 3 different REST
API URIs:

. +restconf/config/onf-ttp:opendaylight-ttps/onf-ttp:table-type-patterns/+
. +restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/{id}/ttp-inventory-node:active_ttp/+
. +restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/{id}/ttp-inventory-node:supported_ttps/+

[NOTE]
===============================
Typically, these URIs are running on the machine the controller is on
at port 8181. If you are on the same machine they can thus be accessed
at +http://localhost:8181/<uri>+
===============================

==== Setting REST HTTP Headers

===== Authentication

The REST API calls require authentication by default. The default
method is to use basic auth with a user name and password of `admin'.

===== Content-Type and Accept

RESTCONF supports both xml and json. This example focuses on JSON, but
xml can be used just as easily. When doing a PUT or POST be sure to
specify the appropriate +Conetnt-Type+ header: either
+application/json+ or +application/xml+.

When doing a GET be sure to specify the appropriate +Accept+ header:
again, either +application/json+ or +application/xml+.

==== Content

The contents of a PUT or POST should be a OpenDaylight Table Type
Pattern. An example of one is provided below. The example can also be
found at https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=ttp.git;a=blob;f=parser/sample-TTP-from-tests.ttp;h=45130949b25c6f86b750959d27d04ec2208935fb;hb=HEAD[+parser/sample-TTP-from-tests.ttp+ in the TTP git repository].

==== Making a REST Call

In this example we'll do a PUT to install the sample TTP from above
into OpenDaylight and then retrieve it both as json and as xml. We'll
use the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm[
Postman - REST Client] for Chrome in the examples, but any method of
accessing REST should work.

First, we'll fill in the basic information:

.Filling in URL, content, Content-Type and basic auth
image::ttp-screen1-basic-auth.png[width=500]

. Set the URL to +http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/onf-ttp:opendaylight-ttps/onf-ttp:table-type-patterns/+
. Set the action to +PUT+
. Click Headers and
. Set a header for +Content-Type+ to +application/json+
. Make sure the content is set to raw and
. Copy the sample TTP from above into the content
. Click the Basic Auth tab and
. Set the username and password to admin
. Click Refresh headers

.Refreshing basic auth headers
image::ttp-screen2-applied-basic-auth.png[width=500]

After clicking Refresh headers, we can see that a new header
(+Authorization+) has been created and this will allow us to
authenticate to make the rest call.

.PUTting a TTP
image::ttp-screen3-sent-put.png[width=500]

At this point, clicking send should result in a Status response of +200
OK+ indicating we've successfully PUT the TTP into OpenDaylight.

.Retrieving the TTP as json via a GET
image::ttp-screen4-get-json.png[width=500]

We can now retrieve the TTP by:

. Changing the action to +GET+
. Setting an +Accept+ header to +application/json+ and
. Pressing send

.Retrieving the TTP as xml via a GET
image::ttp-screen5-get-xml.png[width=500]

The same process can retrieve the content as xml by setting the
+Accept+ header to +application/xml+.

=== Limitations

==== Differences between OpenDaylight TTP and ONF TTP

The OpenDaylight YANG specification for TTPs differs from the ONF's
specification in a few areas. These differences are due to limitations
in the subsets of JSON that YANG schemas can be used to describe.

* *+doc+ members must always be lists and cannot be just a string*

For example, this is not allowed:

----
"doc": "The VLAN ID of a locally attached L2 subnet on a Router."
----

While this is:

----
"doc": ["The VLAN ID of a locally attached L2 subnet on a Router."]
----

[start=2]
* *+table_map+ formats differ*

In the ONF spec, the table_map looks like this

----
"table_map": {
  "ControlFrame": 0,
  "IngressVLAN": 1,
  "MacLearning": 2,
  "L2": 3
},
----

In the ODL TTP YANG definition, it would instead look like this:

----
"table_map": [
    { "name": "ControlFrame", "number": 0 },
    { "name": "IngressVLAN",  "number": 1 },
    { "name": "MacLearning",  "number": 2 },
    { "name": "L2",           "number": 3 },
],
----

[start=3]
* *Limited meta member keywords*

The meta member keywords (+all+, +one_or_more+, +zero_or_more+,
+exactly_one+, and +zero_or_one+) are allowed anywhere in a TTP
according to the ONF specification, but they are only allowed in
specific locations in the ODL YANG schema. Specifically:

.. +all+, +one_or_more+, and +zero_or_more+ are allowed in the +flow_mod_types+ member
.. +exactly_one+ and +zero_or_one+ are allowed in the +match_set+ and
   +instruction_set+ members as well as in in lists of actions.

[start=4]
* *+flow_paths+ repeated table syntax differs*

In the ONF TTP specification, the ability to repeat a table in a path
traversal of the tables is done by having the table be a list
containing the table name as a string. Like this:

----
"flow_paths": ["path": ["table1", ["table2"] ] ]
----

In the ODL YANG schema this is instead represented by moving the square
brackets inside the string as follows:

----
flow_paths": ["path": ["table1", "[table2]" ] ]
----

[start=5]
* *+priority+ and +priority_rank+ must be strings and can't be numbers.

The +priority+ and +priority_rank+ members are allowed to be either
strings or numbers in the ONF specification, but must be strings in the
ODL YANG schema.

* *Empty lists must be omitted*

Lists like this:

----
"match_set": []
----

must instead be omitted from the TTP.

==== Strictly Informational

At this point in time the only operations available with TTPs are
storing and retrieving TTPs from the data store in the three previously
mentioned places.

Additional features that make use of and populate this information are
planned for future releases.

==== Known issues

. Strings containing some special characters result in REST calls
  returning a +400 Bad Request+ code. A string that contains both an
  opening angle bracket (<) and a colon (:) with the angle bracket
  appearing first is known to trigger this behavior.

For example this is known to break RESTCONF:

----
"var": "<<group_entry_types:name>>"
----

While these two work

----
"var": "group_entry_types:name"
----

----
"var": "<<group_entry_types/name>>"
----
