== TTP CLI Tools Developer Guide

=== Overview
The TTP CLI Tools provide a way for people interested in TTPs to read
in, validate, output, and manipulate TTPs as a self-contained,
executable jar file.

=== TTP CLI Tools Architecture
The TTP CLI Tools use the TTP Model and the YANG Tools/RESTCONF codecs
to translate between the Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) and JSON/XML.

=== Command Line Options
This will cover the various options for the CLI Tools. For now, there
are no options and it merely outputs fixed data using the codecs.

// The CLI tools don't have an APIs in the common sense.
//
// === Key APIs and Interfaces
// Document the key things a user would want to use. For some features,
// there will only be one logical grouping of APIs. For others there may be
// more than one grouping.
// 
// Assuming the API is MD-SAL- and YANG-based, the APIs will be available
// both via RESTCONF and via Java APIs. Giving a few examples using each is
// likely a good idea.
// 
// ==== API Group 1
// Provide a description of what the API does and some examples of how to
// use it.
// 
// ==== API Group 2
// Provide a description of what the API does and some examples of how to
// use it.
// 
// === API Reference Documentation
// Provide links to JavaDoc, REST API documentation, etc.
