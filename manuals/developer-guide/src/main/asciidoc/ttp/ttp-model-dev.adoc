== TTP Model Developer Guide

=== Overview
Table Type Patterns are a specification developed by the
https://www.opennetworking.org/[Open Networking Foundation] to enable
the description and negotiation of subsets of the OpenFlow protocol.
This is particularly useful for hardware switches that support OpenFlow
as it enables the to describe what features they do (and thus also what
features they do not) support. More details can be found in the full
specification listed on the
https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/onf-specifications/openflow[OpenFlow
specifications page].

=== TTP Model Architecture
The TTP Model provides a YANG-modeled type for a TTP and allows them
to be associated with a master list of known TTPs, as well as active
and supported TTPs with nodes in the MD-SAL inventory model.

=== Key APIs and Interfaces
The key API provided by the TTP Model feature is the ability to store
a set of TTPs in the MD-SAL as well as associate zero or one active
TTPs and zero or more supported TTPs along with a given node in the
MD-SAL inventory model.

=== API Reference Documentation

==== RESTCONF
See the generated RESTCONF API documentation at:
http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html

Look for the onf-ttp module to expand and see the various RESTCONF
APIs.

==== Java Bindings

//TODO: Provide a link to JavaDoc.

As stated above there are 3 locations where a Table Type Pattern can be
placed into the MD-SAL Data Store. They correspond to 3 different REST
API URIs:

. +restconf/config/onf-ttp:opendaylight-ttps/onf-ttp:table-type-patterns/+
. +restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/{id}/ttp-inventory-node:active_ttp/+
. +restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/{id}/ttp-inventory-node:supported_ttps/+

[NOTE]
===============================
Typically, these URIs are running on the machine the controller is on
at port 8181. If you are on the same machine they can thus be accessed
at +http://localhost:8181/<uri>+

=== Using the TTP Model RESTCONF APIs

==== Setting REST HTTP Headers

===== Authentication

The REST API calls require authentication by default. The default
method is to use basic auth with a user name and password of `admin'.

===== Content-Type and Accept

RESTCONF supports both xml and json. This example focuses on JSON, but
xml can be used just as easily. When doing a PUT or POST be sure to
specify the appropriate +Conetnt-Type+ header: either
+application/json+ or +application/xml+.

When doing a GET be sure to specify the appropriate +Accept+ header:
again, either +application/json+ or +application/xml+.

==== Content

The contents of a PUT or POST should be a OpenDaylight Table Type
Pattern. An example of one is provided below. The example can also be
found at https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=ttp.git;a=blob;f=parser/sample-TTP-from-tests.ttp;h=45130949b25c6f86b750959d27d04ec2208935fb;hb=HEAD[+parser/sample-TTP-from-tests.ttp+ in the TTP git repository].

==== Making a REST Call

In this example we'll do a PUT to install the sample TTP from above
into OpenDaylight and then retrieve it both as json and as xml. We'll
use the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm[
Postman - REST Client] for Chrome in the examples, but any method of
accessing REST should work.

First, we'll fill in the basic information:

.Filling in URL, content, Content-Type and basic auth
image::ttp-screen1-basic-auth.png[width=500]

. Set the URL to +http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/onf-ttp:opendaylight-ttps/onf-ttp:table-type-patterns/+
. Set the action to +PUT+
. Click Headers and
. Set a header for +Content-Type+ to +application/json+
. Make sure the content is set to raw and
. Copy the sample TTP from above into the content
. Click the Basic Auth tab and
. Set the username and password to admin
. Click Refresh headers

.Refreshing basic auth headers
image::ttp-screen2-applied-basic-auth.png[width=500]

After clicking Refresh headers, we can see that a new header
(+Authorization+) has been created and this will allow us to
authenticate to make the REST call.

.PUTting a TTP
image::ttp-screen3-sent-put.png[width=500]

At this point, clicking send should result in a Status response of +200
OK+ indicating we've successfully PUT the TTP into OpenDaylight.

.Retrieving the TTP as json via a GET
image::ttp-screen4-get-json.png[width=500]

We can now retrieve the TTP by:

. Changing the action to +GET+
. Setting an +Accept+ header to +application/json+ and
. Pressing send

.Retrieving the TTP as xml via a GET
image::ttp-screen5-get-xml.png[width=500]

The same process can retrieve the content as xml by setting the
+Accept+ header to +application/xml+.
