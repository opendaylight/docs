== CAPWAP Developer Guide

=== Overview
The Control And Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) plugin project aims to 
provide new southbound interface for controller to be able to monitor and manage 
CAPWAP compliant wireless termination point (WTP) network devices. The CAPWAP 
feature will provide REST based northbound APIs.

=== CAPWAP Architecture
The CAPWAP feature is implemented as an MD-SAL based provider module, which
helps discover WTP devices and update their states in the MD-SAL operational datastore.

=== CAPWAP APIs and Interfaces
This section describes the APIs for interacting with the CAPWAP plugin.
