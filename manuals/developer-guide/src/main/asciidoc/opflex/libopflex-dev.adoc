== OpFlex libopflex Developer Guide

=== Overview
The OpFlex framework allows you to develop agents that can communicate
using the OpFlex protocol and act as a policy element in an
OpFlex-based distributed control system. The OpFlex architecture
provides a distributed control system based on a declarative policy
information model. The policies are defined at a logically centralized
policy repository and enforced within a set of distributed policy
elements. The policy repository communicates with the subordinate
policy elements using the OpFlex control protocol. This protocol
allows for bidirectional communication of policy, events, statistics,
and faults.

Rather than simply providing access to the OpFlex protocol, this
framework allows you to directly manipulate a management information
tree containing a hierarchy of managed objects. This tree is kept in
sync as needed with other policy elements in the system, and you are
automatically notified when important changes to the model
occur. Additionally, we can ensure that only those managed objects
that are important to the local policy element are synchronized
locally.

==== Object Model

Interactions with the OpFlex framework happen through the management
information tree. This is a tree of managed objects defined by an
object model specific to your application. There are a few important
major category of objects that can appear in the model.

* First, there is the policy object. A policy object represents some
  data related to a policy that describes a user intent for how the
  system should behave. A policy object is stored in the policy
  repository which is the source of "truth" for this object.
* Second, there is an endpoint object. A endpoint represents an entity
  in the system to which we want to apply policy, which could be a
  network interface, a storage array, or other relevent policy
  endpoint. Endpoints are discovered and reported by policy elements
  locally, and are synchronized into the endpoint repository. The
  originating policy element is the source of truth for the endpoints
  it discovers. Policy elements can retrieve information about
  endpoints discovered by other policy elements by resolving endpoints
  from the endpoint repository.
* Third, there is the observable object. An observable object
  represents some state related to the operational status or health of
  the policy element. Observable objects will be reported to the
  observer.
* Finally, there is the local-only object. This is the simplest object
  because it exists only local to a particular policy element. These
  objects can be used to store state specific to that policy element,
  or as helpers to resolve other objects. Read on to learn more.

You can use the genie tool that is included with the framework to
produce your application model along with a set of generated accessor
classes that can work with this framework library. You should refer to
the documentation that accompanies the genie tool for information on
how to use to to generate your object model. Later in this guide,
we'll go through examples of how to use the generated managed object
accessor classes.

==== Programming by Side Effect

When developing software on the OpFlex framework, you'll need to think
in a slightly different way. Rather than calling an API function that
would perform some specific action, you'll need to write a managed
object to the managed object database. Writing that object to the
store will trigger the side effect of performing the action that you
want.

For example, a policy element will need to have a component
responsible for discovering policy endpoints. When it discovers a
policy endpoint, it would write an endpoint object into the managed
object database. That endpoint object will contain a reference to
policy that is relevant to the endpoint object. This will trigger a
whole cascade of events. First, the framework will notice that an
endpoint object has been created and it will write it to the endpoint
repository. Second, the framework to will attempt to resolve the
unresolved reference to the relevent policy object. There might be a
whole chain of policy resolutions that will be automatically performed
to download all the relevent policy until there are no longer any
dangling references.

As long as there is a locally-created object in the system with a
reference to that policy, the framework will continually ensure that
the policy and any transitive policies are kept up to date. The policy
element can subscribe to updates to these policy classes that will be
invoked either the first time the policy is resolved or any time the
policy changes.

A consequence of this design is that the managed object database can
be temporarily in an inconsistent state with unresolved dangling
references. Eventually, however, the inconsistency will be fully
resolved. The policy element must be able to cleanly handle
partially-resolved or inconsistent state and eventually reach the
correct state as it receives these update notifications. Note that, in
the OpFlex architecture, when there is no policy that specifically
allows a particular action, that action must be prevented.

Let's cover one slightly more complex example. If a policy element
needs to discover information about an endpoint that is not local to
that policy element, it will need to retrieve that information from
the endpoint repository. However, just as there is no API call to
retrieve a policy object from the policy repository, there is no API
call to retrieve an endpoint from the endpoint repository.

To get this information, the policy element needs to create a
local-only object that references the endpoint. Once it creates this
local-only object, if the endpoint is not already resolved, the
framework will notice the dangling reference and automatically resolve
the endpoint from the endpoint respository. When the endpoint
resolution completes, the framework deliver an update notification to
the policy element. The policy element will continue to receive any
updates related to that endpoint until the policy element remove the
local-only reference to the object. Once this occurs, the framework
can garbage-collect any unreferenced objects.

==== Threading and Ownership
The OpFlex framework uses a somewhat unique threading model. Each
managed object in the system belongs to a particular owner. An owner
would typically be a single thread that is reponsible for all updates
to objects with that owner. Though anything can read the state of a
managed object, only the owner of a managed object is permitted to
write to it. Though this is not strictly required for correctness, the
performance of the system wil be best if you ensure that only one
thread at a time is writing to objects with a particular owner.

Change notifications are delivered in a serialized fashion by a single
thread. Blocking this thread from a notification callback will stall
delivery of all notifications. It is therefore best practice to ensure
that you do not block or perform long-running operations from a
notification callback.

=== Key APIs and Interfaces
==== Basic Usage and Initialization
The primary interface point into the framework is
opflex::ofcore::OFFramework. You can choose to instantiate your own
copy of the framework, or you can use the static default instance.

Before you can use the framework, you must initialize it by installing
your model metadata. The model metadata is accessible through the
generated model library. In this case, it assumes your model is called
"mymodel":

[source,cpp]
----
#include <opflex/ofcore/OFFramework.h>
#include <mymodel/metadata/metadata.hpp>
// ...
using opflex::ofcore::OFFramework;
OFFramework::defaultInstance().setModel(mymodel::getMetadata());
----

The other critical piece of information required for initialization is
the OpFlex identity information. The identity information is required
in order to successfully connect to OpFlex peers. In OpFlex, each
component has a unique name within its policy domain, and each policy
domain is identified by a globally unique domain name. You can set
this identity information by calling:

[source,cpp]
----
OFFramework::defaultInstance()
    .setOpflexIdentity("[component name]", "[unique domain]");
----
You can then start the framework simply by calling:

[source,cpp]
----
OFFramework::defaultInstance().start();
----

Finally, you can add peers after the framework is started by calling
the +opflex::ofcore::OFFramework::addPeer+ method:

[source,cpp]
----
OFFramework::defaultInstance().addPeer("192.168.1.5", 1234);
----

When connecting to the peer, that peer may provide an additional list
of peers to connect to, which will be automatically added as peers. If
the peer does not include itself in the list, then the framework will
disconnect from that peer and add the peers in the list. In this way,
it is possible to automatically bootstrap the correct set of peers
using a known hostname or IP address or a known, fixed anycast IP
address.

To cleanly shut down, you can call:

[source,cpp]
----
OFFramework::defaultInstance().stop();
----

==== Working with Data in the Tree
===== Reading from the Tree

You can access data in the managed tree using the generated accessor
classes. The details of exactly which classes you'll use will depend
on the model you're using, but let's assume that we have a simple
model called "simple" with the following classes:

* root - The root node. The URI for the root node is "/"
* foo - A policy object, and a child of root, with a scalar string
  property called "bar", and a unsigned 64-bit integer property called
  baz. The bar property is the naming property for foo. The URI for a
  foo object would be "/foo/[value of bar]/"
* fooref - A local-only child of root, with a reference to a foo, and
  a scalar string property called "bar". The bar property is the
  naming property for foo. The URI for a fooref object would be
  "/fooref/[value of bar]/"

In this example, we'll have a generated class for each of the
objects. There are two main ways to get access to an object in the
tree.

First, we can get instantiate an accessor class to any node in the
tree by calling one of its static resolve functions. The resolve
functions can take either an already-built URI that represents the
object, or you can call the version that will locate the object by its
naming properties.

Second, we can access the object also from its parent object using the
appropriate child resolver member functions.

However we read it, the object we get back is an immutable view into
the object it references. The properties set locally on that object
will not change even though the underlying object may have been
updated in the store. Note, however, that its children can change
between when you first retrieve the object and when you resolve any
children.

Another thing that is critical to note again is that when you attempt
to resolve an object, you can get back nothing, even if the object
actually does exist on another OpFlex node. You must ensure that some
object in the managed object database references the remote managed
object you want before it will be visible to you.

To get access to the root node using the default framework instance,
we can simply call:

[source,cpp]
----
using boost::shared_ptr;
using boost::optional;
optional<shared_ptr<simple::root> > r(simple::root::resolve());
----

Note that whenever we can a resolve function, we get back our data in
the form of an optional shared pointer to the object instance. If the
node does not exist, then the optional will be set to
boost::none. Note that if you dereference an optional that has not
been set, you'll trigger an assert, so you must check the return as
follows:

[source,cpp]
----
if (!r) {
   // handle missing object
}
----
Now let's get a child node of the root in three different ways:

[source,cpp]
----
// Get foo1 by constructing its URI from the root
optional<shared_ptr<simple::foo> > foo1(simple::foo::resolve("test"));
// get foo1 by constructing its URI relative to its parent
foo1 = r.get()->resolveFoo("test");
// get foo1 by manually building its URI
foo1 = simple::foo::resolve(opflex::modb::URIBuilder()
                               .addElement("foo")
                               .addElement("test")
                               .build());
----

All three of these calls will give us the same object, which is the
"foo" object located at "/foo/test/".

The foo class has a single string property called "bar". We can easily
access it as follows:

[source,cpp]
----
const std::string& barv = foo1.getBar();
----

===== Writing to the Tree
Writing to the tree is nearly as easy as reading from it. The key
concept to understand is the mutator object. If you want to make
changes to the tree, you must allocate a mutator object. The mutator
will register itself in some thread-local storage in the framework
instance you're using. The mutator is specific to a single "owner" for
the data, so you can only make changes to data associated with that
owner.

Whenever you modify one of the accessor classes, the change is
actually forwarded to the currently-active mutator. You won't see any
of the changes you make until you call the commit member function on
the mutator. When you do that, all the changes you made are written
into the store.

Once the changes are written into the store, you will need to call the
appropriate resolve function again to see the changes.

Allocating a mutator is simple. To create a mutator for the default
framework instance associated with the owner "owner1", just allocate
the mutator on the stack. Be sure to call commit() before it goes out
of scope or you'll lose your changes.

[source,cpp]
----
{
    opflex::modb::Mutator mutator("owner1");
    // make changes here
    mutator.commit();
}
----

Note that if an exception is thrown while making changes but before
committing, the mutator will go out of scope and the changes will be
discarded.

To create a new node, you must call the appropriate add[Child] member
function on its parent. This function takes parameters for each of the
naming properties for the object:

[source,cpp]
----
shared_ptr<simple::foo> newfoo(root->addFoo("test"));
----

This will return a shared pointer to a new foo object that has been
registered in the active mutator but not yet committed. The "bar"
naming property will be set automatically, but if you want to set the
"baz" property now, you can do so by calling:

[source,cpp]
----
newfoo->setBaz(42);
----

Note that creating the root node requires a call to the special static
class method createRootElement:

[source,cpp]
----
shared_ptr<simple::root> newroot(simple::root::createRootElement());
----

Here's a complete example that ties this all together:

[source,cpp]
----
{
    opflex::modb::Mutator mutator("owner1");
    shared_ptr<simple::root> newroot(simple::root::createRootElement());
    shared_ptr<simple::root> newfoo(newroot->addFoo("test"));
    newfoo->setBaz(42);
    
    mutator.commit();
}
----

==== Update Notifications
When using the OpFlex framework, you're likely to find that most of
your time is spend responding to changes in the managed object
database. To get these notifications, you're going to need to register
some number of listeners.

You can register an object listener to see all changes related to a
particular class by calling a static function for that class. You'll
then get notifications whenever any object in that class is added,
updated, or deleted. The listener should queue a task to read the new
state and perform appropriate processing. If this function blocks or
peforms a long-running operation, then the dispatching of update
notifications will be stalled, but there will not be any other
deleterious effects.

If multiple changes happen to the same URI, then at least one
notification will be delivered but some events may be consolidated.

The update you get will tell you the URI and the Class ID of the
changed object. The class ID is a unique ID for each class. When you
get the update, you'll need to call the appropriate resolve function
to retrieve the new value.

You'll need to create your own object listener derived from
opflex::modb::ObjectListener:

[source,cpp]
----
class MyListener : public ObjectListener {
public:
    MyListener() { }
    virtual void objectUpdated(class_id_t class_id, const URI& uri) {
        // Your handler here
    }
};
----

To register your listener with the default framework instance, just
call the appropriate class static method:

[source,cpp]
----
MyListener listener;
simple::foo::registerListener(&listener);
// main loop
simple::foo::unregisterListener(&listener);
----

The listener will now recieve notifications whenever any foo or any
children of any foo object changes.

Note that you must ensure that you unregister your listeners before
deallocating them.
