== OpFlex genie Developer Guide

=== Overview
Genie is a tool for code generation from a model.  It supports
generating C\++ and Java code.  C++ can be generated suitable for use
with libopflex. C++ and Java can be generated as a plain set of
objects.

=== Group-based Policy Model
The group-based policy model is included with the genie tool and can
be found under the MODEL directory.  By running mvn exec:java,
libmodelgbp will be generated as a library project that, when built
and installed, will work with libopflex.  This model is used by the
OVS agent.

=== API Reference Documentation
Complete API documentation for the generated libmodelgbp can be found here:
