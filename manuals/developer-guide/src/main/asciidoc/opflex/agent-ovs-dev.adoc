== OpFlex agent-ovs Developer Guide

=== Overview
agent-ovs is a policy agent that works with OVS to enforce a
group-based policy networking model with locally attached virtual
machines or containers. The policy agent is designed to work well with
orchestration tools like OpenStack.

=== agent-ovs Architecture
agent-ovs uses libopflex to communicate with an OpFlex-based policy
repository to enforce policy on network endpoints attached to OVS by
an orchestration system.

The key components are:

* Agent - coordinates startup and configuration
* Renderers - Renderers are responsible for rendering policy.  This is
  a very general mechanism but the currently-implemented renderer is
  the stitched-mode renderer that can work along with with hardware
  fabrics such as ACI that support policy enforcement.
* EndpointManager - Keep track of network endpoints and declare them
  to the endpoint repository
* PolicyManager - Keep track of and index policies
* FlowManager - render policies to OVS
