== NATApp  Developer Guide

=== Overview
NATApp  acts as a basic framework for providing  NAT functionality
to the SDN controller. One can use REST or Java APIs to enter global IP address into
YANG Data Store which will be used by the odl-natapp-feature to map 
local IP to global IP addresses. 

=== NATApp  Architecture
NATApp listens on OpenFlow southbound interface for Packet_In messages. The application parses
the message for header information. If the received message has a local IP address the application
installs rules on the OpenFlow switch for network address translation from local to global IP addresses.
NATApp has NATPacketHandler class that implements the PacketProcessing interface to override the 
OnPacketReceived notification by which the application is notified of Packet_In messages.

NATApp is implemented with the help of a few java classes.

. NATPacketHandler
  * Receives Packet_In messages coming to the controller and process them appropriately
. NATPacketParsing
  * Decodes Packet_In messages for packet header information (L2, L3 & L4 information)
. NATInventoryUtility
  * Decodes Packet_In messages for OpenFlow Switch and Port information 
. NATFlowBuilder
  * Creates NAT flow rules at the OpenFlow Switch
. NATYangStore
  * Reads Global IP entered by user and maps local IP to Global IP information 
. NATFlowHandler
  * Manages expired flows in the switch and frees up used global IP address for future natting.
