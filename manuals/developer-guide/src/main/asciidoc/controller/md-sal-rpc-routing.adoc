=== MD-SAL RPC routing

The MD-SAL provides a way to deliver Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs) to a
particular implementation based on content in the input as it is modeled in
YANG. This part of the the RPC input is referred to as a *context reference*.

The MD-SAL does not dictate the name of the leaf which is used for this RPC
routing, but provides necessary functionality for YANG model author to define
their *context reference* in their model of RPCs.

MD-SAL routing behavior is modeled using following terminology and its
application to YANG models:

Context Type::
  Logical type of RPC routing. Context type is modeled as YANG `identity`
  and is referenced in model to provide scoping information.
Context Instance::
  Conceptual location in data tree, which represents context in which RPC
  could be executed. Context instance usually represent logical point
  to which RPC execution is attached.
Context Reference::
  Field of RPC input payload which contains Instance Identifier referencing
  *context instance*  in which the RPC should be executed.

==== Modeling a routed RPC

In order to define routed RPCs, the YANG model author needs to declare (or
reuse) a *context type*, set of possible *context instances* and finally RPCs
which will contain *context reference* on which they will be routed.

===== Declaring a routing context type

[source,yang]
----
identity node-context {
    description "Identity used to mark node context";
}
----

This declares an identity named `node-context`, which is used as marker
for node-based routing and is used in other places to reference that routing
type.

===== Declaring possible context instances

In order to define possible values of *context instances* for routed RPCs, we
need to model that set accordingly using `context-instance` extension from the
`yang-ext` model.

[source,yang]
----
import yang-ext { prefix ext; }

/** Base structure **/
container nodes {
    list node {
        key "id";
        ext:context-instance "node-context";
        // other node-related fields would go here
    }
}
----

The statement `ext:context-instance "node-context";` marks any element of the
`list node` as a possible valid *context instance* in `node-context` based
routing.

[NOTE]
====
The existence of a *context instance* node in operational or config data tree
is not strongly tied to existence of RPC implementation.

For most routed RPC models, there is relationship between the data present in
operational data tree and RPC implementation availability, but this is
not enforced by MD-SAL. This provides some flexibility for YANG model writers
to better specify their routing model and requirements for implementations.
Details when RPC implementations are available should be documented in YANG model.

If user invokes RPC with a *context instance* that has no registered
implementation, the RPC invocation will fail with the exception
`DOMRpcImplementationNotAvailableException`.
====

===== Declaring a routed RPC

To declare RPC to be routed based on `node-context` we need to add leaf
of `instance-identifier` type (or type derived from `instance-identifier`)
to the RPC and mark it as *context reference*.

This is achieved using YANG extension `context-reference` from `yang-ext` model
on leaf, which will be used for RPC routing.

[source,yang]
----
rpc example-routed-rpc  {
    input {
        leaf node {
            ext:context-reference "node-context";
            type "instance-identifier";
        }
        // other input to the RPC would go here
    }
}
----

The statement `ext:context-reference "node-context"` marks `leaf node` as
*context reference* of type `node-context`. The value of this leaf, will be used
by the MD-SAL to select the particular RPC implementation that registered itself
as the implementation of the RPC for particular *context instance*.

==== Using routed RPCs

From a user perspective (e.g. invoking RPCs) there is no difference between
routed and non-routed RPCs. Routing information is just an additional leaf in
RPC which must be populated.

// TODO: Add simple snippet of invoking such RPC even if it does not differ
// from normal one.

==== Implementing a routed RPC

// TODO: Update this section to show some other example model
// along with binding and DOM implementations

Implementation

===== Registering implementations

// FIXME: Clean up bit wording in following section, use different example

Implementations of a routed RPC (e.g., southbound plugins) will specify an
instance-identifier for the *context reference* (in this case a node) for which
they want to provide an implementation during registration. Consumers, e.g.,
those calling the RPC are required to specify that instance-identifier (in this
case the identifier of a node) when invoking RPC.

Simple code which showcases that for add-flow via Binding-Aware APIs

 63      assertNotNull(session);
 64      firstReg = session.addRoutedRpcImplementation(SalFlowService.class, salFlowService1);
 65  }
----

SalFlowService RPC

[source, java]
----
107  NodeRef nodeOne = createNodeRef("foo:node:1");
109  /**
110   * Provider 1 registers path of node 1
111   */
112  firstReg.registerPath(NodeContext.class, nodeOne);
----

Line 107: We are creating NodeRef (encapsulation of InstanceIdentifier)
for "foo:node:1".

Line 112: We register salFlowService1 as implementation for nodeOne.

The salFlowService1 will be executed only for RPCs which contains
Instance Identifier for foo:node:1.
