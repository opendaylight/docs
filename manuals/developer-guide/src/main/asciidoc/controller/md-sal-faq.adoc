=== OpenDaylight Controller: MD-SAL FAQs

*Q-1: What is the overall MD-SAL architecture?*

* **What is the overall architecture, components, and functionality?**
* **Who supplies which components, and how are the components plumbed?**

*A-1:* The overall Model-Driven SAL (MD-SAL) architecture did not really change
from the API-Driven SAL (AD-SAL). As with the AD-SAL, plugins can be data
providers, or data consumers, or both (although the AD-SAL did not explicitly
name them as such). Just like the AD-SAL, the MD-SAL connects data consumers
to appropriate data providers and (optionally) facilitates data adaptation
between them.

Now, in the AD-SAL, the SAL APIs request routing between consumers and
providers, and data adaptations are all statically defined at compile or
build time. In the MD-SAL, the SAL APIs and request routing between consumers
and providers are defined from models, and data adaptations are provided by
'internal' adaptation plugins. The API code is generated from models when
a plugin is compiled. When the plugin OSGI bundle is loaded into the controller,
the API code is loaded into the controller along with the rest of the plugin
containing the model.

The AD-SAL provides request routing (selects an SB plugin based on service type)
and optionally provides service adaptation, if an NB (Service, abstract) API
is different from its corresponding SB (protocol) API. For example, in the above
figure, the AD-SAL routes requests from NB-Plugin 1 to SB Plugins 1 and 2. Note
that the plugin SB and NB APIs in this example are essentially the same
(although both of them need to be defined). Request routing is based on plugin
type: the SAL knows which node instance is served by which plugin. When an NB
Plugin requests an operation on a given node, the request is routed to the
appropriate plugin which then routes the request to the appropriate node.
The AD-SAL can also provide service abstractions and adaptations. For example,
in the above figure, NB Plugin 2 is using an abstract API to access the services
provided by SB Plugins 1 and 2. The translation between the SB Plugin API and
the abstract NB API is done in the Abstraction module in the AD-SAL.

The MD-SAL provides request routing and the infrastructure to support service
adaptation. However, it does not provide service adaptation itself: service
adaptation is provided by plugins. From the point of view of MD-SAL,
the Adaptation Plugin is a regular plugin. It provides data to the SAL,
and consumes data from the SAL through APIs generated from models.
An Adaptation Plugin basically performs model-to-model translations
between two APIs. Request Routing in the MD-SAL is done on both protocol type
and node instances, since node instance data is exported from the plugin into
the SAL (the model data contains routing information).

The simplest MD-SAL APIs generated from models (RPCs and Notifications, both
supported in the yang modeling language) are functionally equivalent to AD-SAL
function call APIs. Additionally, the MD-SAL can store data for models defined
by plugins. Provider and consumer plugins can exchange data through the MD-SAL
storage. Data in the MD-SAL is accessed through getter and setter APIs generated
from models. Note that this is in contrast to the AD-SAL, which is stateless.

Note that in the above figure, both NB AD-SAL Plugins provide REST APIs to
controller client applications.

The functionality provided by the MD-SAL is basically to facilitate the plumbing
between providers and consumers. A provider or a consumer can register itself
with the MD-SAL. A consumer can find a provider that it is interested in.
A provider can generate notifications; a consumer can receive notifications
and issue RPCs to get data from providers. A provider can insert data into SAL
storage; a consumer can read data from SAL storage.

Note that the structure of SAL APIs is different in the MD-SAL from that in the
AD-SAL. The AD-SAL typically has both NB and SB APIs even for functions or
services that are mapped 1:1 between SB Plugins and NB Plugins. For example,
in the current AD-SAL implementation of the OpenFlow Plugin and applications,
the NB SAL APIs used by OF applications are mapped 1:1 onto SB OF Plugin APIs.
The MD-SAL allows both the NB plugins and SB plugins to use the same
API generated from a model. One plugin becomes an API (service) provider;
the other becomes an API (service) Consumer. This eliminates the need to define
two different APIs and to provide three different implementations even for cases
where APIs are mapped to each other 1:1. The MD SAL provides instance-based
request routing between multiple provider plugins.

*Q-2: What functionality does the MD-SAL assume? For example, does the SAL
assume that the network model is a part of the SAL?*

*A-2:* The MD-SAL does not assume any model. All models are provided by plugins.
The MD-SAL only provides the infrastructure and the plumbing for the plugins.


*Q-3: What is the "day in the life" of an MD-SAL plugin?*


*A-3:* All plugins (protocol, application, adaptation, and others) have the same
lifecycle. The life of a plugin has two distinct phases: design and operation. +
During the design phase, the plugin designer performs the following actions:  +

* The designer decides which data will be consumed by the plugin, and imports
the SAL APIs generated from the API provider’s models. Note that the topology
model is just one possible data type that may be consumed by a plugin. The list
of currently available data models and their APIs can be found in
YANG_Tools:Available_Models.
* The designer decides which data and how it will be provided by the plugin,
and designs the data model for the provided data. The data model
(expressed in yang) is then run through the
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/YANG_Tools:Available_Models[YANG Tools],
which generate the SAL APIs for the model.
* The implementations for the generated consumer and provider APIs, along with
  other plugin features and functionality, are developed. The resulting code
  is packaged in a “plugin” OSGI bundle. Note that a developer may package the
  code of a subsystem in multiple plugins or applications that may communicate
  with each other through the SAL.
* The generated APIs and a set of helper classes are also built and packaged
  in an “API” OSGI bundle.

The plugin development process is shown in the following figure. +

.Plugin development process

When the OSGI bundle of a plugin is loaded into the controller and activated,
the operation phase begins. The plugin operation is probably best explained
with a few examples describing the operation of the OF Protocol plugin and
OF applications, such as the Flow Programmer Service, the ARP Handler,
or the Topology Manager. The following figure shows a scenario where a
“Flow Deleted” notification from a switch arrives at the controller.

.Flow deleted at controller
image::flow-deleted-at-controller.png[]

The scenario is as follows: +

. The Flow Programmer Service registers with the MD SAL for the `Flow Deleted'
  notification. This is done when the Controller and its plugins or applications
   are started.
. A `Flow Deleted' OF packet arrives at the controller. The OF Library receives
the packet on the TCP/TLS connection to the sending switch, and passes it to the
OF Plugin.
. The OF Plugin parses the packet, and uses the parsed data to create a
`Flow Deleted' SAL notification. The notification is actually an immutable
`Flow Deleted' Data Transfer Object (DTO) that is created or populated by means
of methods from the model-generated OF Plugin API.
. The OF Plugin sends the `Flow Deleted' SAL notification (containing the
  notification DTO) into the SAL. The SAL routes the notification to registered
  consumers, in this case, the Flow Programmer Service.
. The Flow Programmer Service receives the notification containing the
  notification DTO.
. The Flow Programmer Service uses methods from the API of the model-generated
  OF Plugin to get data from the immutable notification DTO received in Step 5.
  The processing is the same as in the AD-SAL.

Note that other packet-in scenarios, where a switch punts a packet to
the controller, such as an ARP or an LLDP packet, are similar. Interested
applications register for the respective notifications. The OF plugin generates
the notification from received OF packets, and sends them to the SAL.
The SAL routes the notifications to the registered recipients. +
The following figure shows a scenario where an external application adds a
flow by means of the NB REST API of the controller.

.External app adds flow
image::md-sal-faqs-add_flow.png[]

The scenario is as follows: +

. Registrations are performed when the Controller and its plugins
 or applications are started.

.. The Flow Programmer Service registers with the MD SAL for Flow configuration
data notifications.
.. The OF Plugin registers (among others) the ‘AddFlow’ RPC implementation with
   the SAL.
Note that the RPC is defined in the OF Plugin model, and the API is generated
during build time. +
[start=2]
. A client application requests a flow add through the REST API of the
Controller. (Note that in the AD-SAL, there is a dedicated NB REST API on top
of the Flow Programming Service. The MD-SAL provides a common infrastructure
where data and functions defined in models can be accessed by means of a common
REST API. For more information, see http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/). The client application provides all parameters for the flow in the REST call.
. Data from the ‘Add Flow’ request is deserialized, and a new flow is created
  in the Flow Service configuration data tree. (Note that in this example
  the configuration and operational data trees are separated; this may be
  different for other services). Note also that the REST call returns success
  to the caller as soon as the flow data is written to the configuration data tree.
. Since the Flow Programmer Service is registered to receive notifications
  for data changes in the Flow Service data tree, the MD-SAL generates a
  ‘data changed’ notification to the Flow Programmer Service.
. The Flow Programmer Service reads the newly added flow, and performs
  a flow add operation (which is basically the same as in the AD-SAL).
. At some point during the flow addition operation, the Flow Programmer Service
  needs to tell the OF Plugin to add the flow in the appropriate switch.
  The Flow Programmer Service uses the OF Plugin generated API to create
  the RPC input parameter DTO for the “AddFlow” RPC of the OF Plugin.
. The Flow Programmer Service gets the service instance (actually, a proxy),
  and invokes the “AddFlow” RPC on the service. The MD-SAL will route
  the request to the appropriate OF Plugin (which implements the requested RPC).
. The `AddFlow' RPC request is routed to the OF Plugin, and the implementation
  method of the “AddFlow” RPC is invoked.
. The `AddFlow' RPC implementation uses the OF Plugin API to read values from
  the DTO of the RPC input parameter. (Note that the implementation will use
  the getter methods of the DTO generated from the yang model of the RPC to read
  the values from the received DTO.)
. The `AddFlow' RPC is further processed (pretty much the same as in the AD-SAL)
  and at some point, the corresponding flowmod is sent to the corresponding switch.

*Q-4: Is there a document that describes how code is generated from the models
for the MD-SAL?*

*A-4:* https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/YANG_Tools:YANG_to_Java_Mapping[Yangtools]
documents the Yang to Java generation, including examples of how the yang
constructs are mapped into Java classes. You can write unit tests against
the generated code. You will have to write implementations of the generated
RPC interfaces. The generated code is just Java, and it debugs just like Java.

If you want to play with generating Java from Yang there is a maven archetype
to help you get going: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Maven_Archetypes:odl-model-project[Maven Archetypes: ODL Model Project]. +
Or, you can try creating a project in Eclipse as explained at: http://sdntutorials.com/yang-to-java-conversion-how-to-create-maven-project-in-eclipse/[YANG to Java conversion: How to create Maven project in Eclipse].

*Q-5: The code generation tools mention 'producers' and consumers'.
How are these related to 'southbound' and 'northbound SAL plugins?*

*A-5:* The difference between southbound and northbound plugins is that
the southbound plugins talk protocols to network nodes, and northbound
plugins talk application APIs to the controller applications. As far
as the SAL is concerned, there is really no north or south.
The SAL is basically a data exchange and adaptation mechanism between plugins.
The plugin SAL roles (consumer or producer) are defined with respect to
the data being moved around or stored by the SAL. A producer implements an API,
and provides the data of the API: a consumer uses the API, and consumes the data
of the API. +
While 'northbound' and 'southbound' provide a network engineer's view of the SAL,
 'consumer' and 'producer' provide a software engineer's view of the SAL, and is
  shown in the following figure:

.SAL consumer and producer view

*Q-6: Where can I find models that have already been defined in OpenDaylight?*

*A-6:* The list of models that have been defined for the SAL and in various
plugins can be found in https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Model_Reference[MD-SAL Model Reference].

*Q-7: How do I migrate my existing plugins and services to MD-SAL?*

*A-7:* The migration guide can be found in the
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Application_Migration_Guide[MD-SAL Application Migration Guide].

*Q-8: Where can I find SAL example code?*

*A-8:* The toaster sample provides a simple yet complete example of a model,
a service provider (toaster), and a service consumer. It provides the model
of a programmable toaster, a sample consumer application that uses
MD-SAL APIs; a sample southbound plugin (a service provider) that implements
toaster; and a unit test suite.

The toaster example is in _controller.git_ under _opendaylight/md-sal/samples_.

*Q-9: Where is the REST API code for the example?*

*A-9:* The REST APIs are derived from models. You do not have to write any code
for it. The controller will implement the
http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-bierman-netconf-restconf/[RESTCONF protocol]
which defines access to yang-formatted data through REST. Basically, all you
need to do is define your service in a model, and expose that model to the SAL.
REST access to your modeled data will then be provided by the SAL infrastructure.
However, if you want to, you can create your own REST API (for example, to be
   compliant with an existing API).

*Q-10: How can one use RESTCONF to access the MD-SAL datastore?*

*A-10:* For information on accessing the MD-SAL datastore, see
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:MD-SAL:Restconf[MD-SAL Restconf].
