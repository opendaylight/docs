== Network Intent Composition (NIC) Developer Guide

=== Overview
The Network Intent Composition (NIC) provides two features:

* odl-nic-core - the basic model and infrastructure for the NIC capabilities

* odl-nic-cli - support for the karaf console CLI NIC commands

* odl-nic-renderer-vtn - a feature that transforms an intent to a network
modification

* odl-nic-renderer-gbp - a feature that transforms an intent to a network
modification

_Only a single renderer feature should be installed at a time for the Lithium
release._

=== odl-nic-core
This feature supplies the base models for the Network Intent Composition (NIC)
capability. This includes the definition of intent as well as the configuration
and operational data trees.

This feature only provides an information model. The interface for NIC is to
modify the information model via the configuraiton data tree, which will
trigger the renderer to make the appropriate changes in the controlled
network.

==== POST / PUT (configuration)
This operations create instances of an intent in the configuration data tree
and trigger the creation or modification of an intent.

==== GET (configuration / operational)
This operation lists all or fetches a single intent from the data tree.

==== DELETE (configuration)
This operation will cause an intent to be removed from the system and trigger
any configuration changes on the network rendered from this intent to be
removed.

=== odl-nic-cli
This feature provides karaf console CLI command to manipulate the intent
data model. The CLI essentailly invokes the equivalent data operations.

==== intent:add
Creates a new intent in the configuration data tree

==== intent:update
Updates an existing intent in the configuration data tree

==== intent:delete
Removes an existing intent from the system

==== intent:list
Lists all the intents in the system

==== intent:show
Displayes the details of a single intent
