== NIC Model Developer Guide

=== Overview
The NIC Model provides an abstract model for expressing the desired
state and operation of the network.

NOTE: To be clear the target audience for this guide is a developer who
will be _using_ the feature to build something separate, but _not_
somebody who will be developing code for this feature itself.

=== NIC Model Architecture
TODO: provide NIC architecture when we have a better idea what the
final (at least for Lithium) model will look like.

=== NIC Model API
TODO: Describe the agreed-upon model and the thus the generated APIs.

=== API Reference Documentation
TODO: Provide links to to how to get to the RESTCONF APIdoc and to the
generated Javadoc from the YANG generated Java code.
