== ALTO Developer Guide
=== ALTO Overview
The ALTO (Application-Layer Traffic Optimization) features provide two sets of 
functions: (1) a northbound interface based on RFC7285 to provide ALTO services 
to ALTO clients; and (2) an ALTO manager so that a network administrator can 
provision the data of the services.


=== ALTO Architecture
* *alto-model*
   ** Provides the YANG model
* *alto-provider*
   ** Implements the services
* *northbound*
   ** Provides the translation between RFC7285 and YANG data store

=== Key APIs and Interfaces
ALTO in OpenDayLight is MD-SAL- and YANG-based, and hence there are two 
APIs that will be available: via RESTCONF and via RFC 7285. 

==== RESTCONF API
This will serve as the provision API.

==== RFC7285 API
This will serve as the standard API for ALTO clients.

=== API Reference Documentation
Please see RFC7285 for the RFC7285 API.
