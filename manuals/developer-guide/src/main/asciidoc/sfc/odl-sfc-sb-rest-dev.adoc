=== SFC Southbound REST Plugin Developer Guide

==== Overview
The Southbound REST Plugin is used to send configuration from DataStore down to
network devices supporting a REST API (i.e. they have a configured REST URI).
It supports POST/PUT/DELETE operations, which are triggered accordingly to
changes in DataStore.

.In its current state it listens to changes in these DataStores:
* Access List (ACL)
* Service Classifier (SCF)
* Service Function (SF)
* Service Function Group (SFG)
* Service Function Schedule Type (SFST)
* Service Function Forwader (SFF)
* Rendered Service Path (RSP)

==== Southbound REST Plugin Architecture
.The Southbound REST Plugin is built from three main components:
. listeners - used to listen on changes in DataStore
. json exporters - used to export JSONs from binding-aware DataStore objects
. tasks - used to collect REST URIs of network devices and to send JSONs down
to these devices.

==== Key APIs and Interfaces
The plugin provides Southbound REST API designated to listening REST devices. It supports
POST/PUT/DELETE operations. The operation (with corresponding JSON encoded data) is send
to unique REST URL belonging to certain datatype.

.The URLs are following:
* Access List (ACL):
+http://<host>:<port>/config/ietf-acl:access-lists/access-list/+
* Service Function (SF): 
+http://<host>:<port>/config/service-function:service-functions/service-function/+
* Service Function Group (SFG): 
+http://<host>:<port>/config/service-function:service-function-groups/service-function-group/+
* Service Function Schedule Type (SFST): 
+http://<host>:<port>/config/service-function-scheduler-type:service-function-scheduler-types/service-function-scheduler-type/+
* Service Function Forwarder (SFF): 
+http://<host>:<port>/config/service-function-forwarder:service-function-forwarders/service-function-forwarder/+
* Rendered Service Path (RSP): 
+http://<host>:<port>/operational/rendered-service-path:rendered-service-paths/rendered-service-path/+

Therefore, network devices willing to receive REST messages must listen on
these REST URLs.
