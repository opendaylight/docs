=== Service Function Scheduling Algorithms

==== Overview
When creating the Rendered Service Path (RSP), the earlier release of SFC
chose the first available service function from a list of service function
names. Now a new API is introduced to allow developers to develop their own
schedule algorithms when creating the RSP. There are four scheduling algorithms
(Random, Round Robin, Load Balance and Shortest Path) are provided as examples
for the API definition. This guide gives a simple introduction of how to develop
service function scheduling algorithms based on the current extensible framework.

==== Architecture
The following figure illustrates the service function selection framework and
algorithms.

The YANG Model defines the Service Function Scheduling Algorithm type
identities and how they are stored in the MD-SAL data store for the scheduling
algorithms.

The MD-SAL data store stores all informations for the scheduling algorithms,
including their types, names, and status.

The API provides some basic APIs to manage the informations stored in the
MD-SAL data store, like putting new items into it, getting all scheduling
algorithms, etc.

The RESTCONF API provides APIs to manage the informations stored in the MD-SAL
data store through RESTful calls.

The Service Function Chain Renderer gets the enabled scheduling algorithm type,
and schedules the service functions with scheduling algorithm implementation.

==== Key APIs and Interfaces
While developing a new Service Function Scheduling Algorithm, a new class
should be added and it should extend the base schedule class
SfcServiceFunctionSchedulerAPI. And the new class should implement the abstract
function:

+public List<String> scheduleServiceFuntions(ServiceFunctionChain chain, int serviceIndex)+.

.input
* *+ServiceFunctionChain chain+*: the chain which will be rendered
* *+int serviceIndex+*: the initial service index for this rendered service path

.output
* *+List<String>+*: a list of service funtion names which scheduled by the
Service Function Scheduling Algorithm.
