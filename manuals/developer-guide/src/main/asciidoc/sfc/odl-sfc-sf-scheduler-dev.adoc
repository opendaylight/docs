=== Service Function Scheduling Algorithm

==== Overview
When creating the Rendered Service Path(RSP), the ealier release of SFC chooses the first available service function from a list of service function names. Now a new API is introduced to allow developers to develop their own schedule algorithms when creating the RSP. There are three scheduling algorithm(Random, Round Robin and Load Balance) are upstreamed as examples for the API definition. This guide gives a simple introduction of how to develop service function scheduling algorithms based on the current extensible framework.

==== Architecture
The following figure illustrates the service function selection framework and algorithms.

The YANG Model defines the Service Function Scheduling Algorithm type indentities and the structures how they are stored in the MD-SAL datastore for the scheduling algorithms.
The MD-SAL datastore stores all informations for the scheduling algorithms, including their types, names, and status.
The API provides some basic APIs to manage the informations stored in the MD-SAL datastore, like putting new items into it, getting all scheduling algorithms, etc.
The RESTConf API provides APIs to manage the informations stored in the MD-SAL datastore through RESTFul calls.
The Service Function Chain Renderer gets enabled scheduling algorithm type, and schedules the service functions with scheduling algorithm implementations.

==== Key APIs and Interfaces
While developing a new Service Function Scheduling Algorithm, a new class should be added, and it should extend the base schedule class SfcServiceFunctionSchedulerAPI. And the new class should implement the abstract function
   public List<String> scheduleServiceFuntions(ServiceFunctionChain chain, int serviceIndex).

input:
ServiceFunctionChain chain: the chain which will be rendered.
int serviceIndex: the initial service index for this rendered service path.
output:
List<String>: A list of service funtion names which scheduled by the Service Function Scheduling Algorithm.

===== API Group 1
