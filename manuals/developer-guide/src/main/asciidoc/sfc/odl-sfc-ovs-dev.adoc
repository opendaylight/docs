=== SFC-OVS Plugin

==== Overview
SFC-OVS provides integration of SFC with Open vSwitch (OVS) devices.
Integration is realized through mapping of SFC objects (like SF, SFF,
Classifier, etc.) to OVS objects (like Bridge, TerminationPoint=Port/Interface).
The mapping takes care of automatic instantiation (setup) of corresponding object
whenever its counterpart is created. For example, when a new SFF is created,
the SFC-OVS plugin will create a new OVS bridge and when a new OVS Bridge is
created, the SFC-OVS plugin will create a new SFF.

==== SFC-OVS Architecture
SFC-OVS uses the OVSDB MD-SAL Southbound API for getting/writing information
from/to OVS devices. The core functionality consists of two types of mapping:

a. mapping from OVS to SFC
** OVS Bridge is mapped to SFF
** OVS TerminationPoints are mapped to SFF DataPlane locators

b. mapping from SFC to OVS
** SFF is mapped to OVS Bridge
** SFF DataPlane locators are mapped to OVS TerminationPoints

==== Key APIs and Interfaces
* SFF to OVS mapping API (methods to convert SFF object to OVS Bridge
and OVS TerminationPoints)
* OVS to SFF mapping API (methods to convert OVS Bridge and OVS TerminationPoints
to SFF object)
