=== SFC-OVS Plugin

==== Overview
SFC-OVS provides integration of SFC with OpenVSwitch (OVS) devices.
Integration is realized through mapping of SFC objects (like SF, SFF,
Classifier, etc.) to OVS objects (like Bridge, TerminationPoint=Port/Interface).
The mapping takes care of automatic instantiation (setup) of corresponding objects
whenever it's opossite is created. E.g. new SFF --create-- > OVS Bridge, new OVS
Bridge --create-- > SFF, etc.

==== SFC-OVS Architecture
SFC-OVS uses OVSDB MDSAL Southbound API for getting/writing information from/to
OVS devices. The core functionality consists of two types of mapping:

a. mapping from OVS to SFC
** OVS Bridge is mapped to SFF
** OVS TerminationPoints are mapped to SFF DataPlane locators

b. mapping from SFC to OVS
** SFF is mapped to OVS Bridge
** SFF DataPlane locators are mapped to OVS TerminationPoints

==== Key APIs and Interfaces
* SFF to OVS mapping API (methods to convert SFF object to OVS Bridge
and OVS TerminationPoints)
* OVS to SFF mapping API (methods to convert OVS Bridge and OVS TerminationPoints
to SFF object)
