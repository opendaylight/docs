=== OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) Overview

OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) is an application that provides multi-tenant virtual network on an SDN controller.

Conventionally, huge investment in the network systems and operating expenses are needed because the network is configured as a silo for each department and system. Therefore various network appliances must be installed for each tenant and those boxes cannot be shared with others. It is a heavy work to design, implement and operate the entire complex network.

The uniqueness of VTN is a logical abstraction plane. This enables the complete separation of logical plane from physical plane. Users can design and deploy any desired network without knowing the physical network topology or bandwidth restrictions.

VTN allows the users to define the network with a look and feel of conventional L2/L3 network. Once the network is designed on VTN, it will automatically be mapped into underlying physical network, and then configured on the individual switch leverage SDN control protocol. The definition of logical plane makes it possible not only to hide the complexity of the underlying network but also to better manage network resources. It achieves reducing reconfiguration time of network services and minimizing network configuration errors. OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) is an application that provides multi-tenant virtual network on an SDN controller. It provides API for creating a common virtual network irrespective of the physical network.

.VTN Architecture
image::vtn/vtn-overview.png[width=500]

It is implemented as two major components

* <<_vtn_manager,VTN Manager>>
* <<_vtn_coordinator,VTN Coordinator>>

==== VTN Manager
An OpenDaylight Plugin that interacts with other modules to implement the components of the VTN model. It also provides a REST interface to configure VTN components in OpenDaylight. VTN Manager is implemented as one plugin to the OpenDaylight. This provides a REST interface to create/update/delete VTN components. The user command in VTN Coordinator is translated as REST API to VTN Manager by the OpenDaylight Driver component. In addition to the above mentioned role, it also provides an implementation to the OpenStack L2 Network Functions API.

===== Function Outline

The table identifies the functions and the interface used by VTN Components:

[options="header"]
|===
| Component | Interface | Purpose
| VTN Manager |RESTful API | Configure VTN Virtualization model components in OpenDaylight
| VTN Manager | Neutron API implementation | Handle Networks API from OpenStack (Neutron Interface)
| VTN Coordinator | RESTful API |
(1) Uses the RESTful interface of VTN Manager and configures VTN Virtualization model components in OpenDaylight. +
(2) Handles multiple OpenDaylight orchestration. +
(3) Provides API to read the physical network details. See https://wiki.OpenDaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_(VTN):VTN_Coordinator:RestApi:L2_Network_Example_Using_VTN_Virtualization[samples] for usage.

===== Feature Overview

There are three features

* *odl-vtn-manager* provides VTN Manager's JAVA API.
* *odl-vtn-manager-rest* provides VTN Manager's REST API.
* *odl-vtn-manager-neutron* provides the integration with Neutron interface.

REST API documentation for VTN Manager, please refer to:
https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/

For VTN Java API documentation, please refer to: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/target/apidocs/index.html

Once the karaf distribution is up, install dlux and apidocs.

====== Logging In

To Log in to DLUX, after installing the application:

* Open a browser and enter the login URL as http://<OpenDaylight-IP>:8181/index.html.

NOTE: Replace "<OpenDaylight-IP>" with the IP address of OpenDaylight  based on your environment.

* Login to the application with user ID and password credentials as admin.

NOTE: admin is the only default user available for DLUX in this release.

* In the right hand side frame, click "Yang UI".

YANG documentation for VTN Manager, please refer to: https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/

==== VTN Coordinator

The VTN Coordinator is an external application that provides a REST interface for an user to use OpenDaylight VTN Virtualization. It interacts with VTN Manager plugin to implement the user configuration. It is also capable of multiple OpenDaylight orchestration. It realizes VTN provisioning in OpenDaylight instances. In the OpenDaylight architecture VTN Coordinator is part of the network application, orchestration and services layer. VTN Coordinator will use the REST interface exposed by the VTN Manger to realize the virtual network using OpenDaylight. It uses OpenDaylight APIs (REST) to construct the virtual network in OpenDaylight instances. It provides REST APIs for northbound VTN applications and supports virtual networks spanning across multiple OpenDaylight by coordinating across OpenDaylight.

===== Feature Overview

VTN Coordinator doesn't have Karaf features.

For VTN Coordinator REST API, please refer to: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Virtual_Tenant_Network_%28VTN%29:VTN_Coordinator:RestApi
