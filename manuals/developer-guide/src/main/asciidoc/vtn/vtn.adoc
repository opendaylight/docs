=== Virtual Tenant Network (VTN)

==== OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) Overview

OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) is an application that provides multi-tenant virtual network on an SDN controller.

Conventionally, huge investment in the network systems and operating expenses are needed because the network is configured as a silo for each department and system. Therefore various network appliances must be installed for each tenant and those boxes cannot be shared with others. It is a heavy work to design, implement and operate the entire complex network.
The uniqueness of VTN is a logical abstraction plane. This enables the complete separation of logical plane from physical plane. Users can design and deploy any desired network without knowing the physical network topology or bandwidth restrictions.
VTN allows the users to define the network with a look and feel of conventional L2/L3 network. Once the network is designed on VTN, it will automatically be mapped into underlying physical network, and then configured on the individual switch leveraging SDN control protocol. The definition of logical plane makes it possible not only to hide the complexity of the underlying network but also to better manage network resources. It achieves reducing reconfiguration time of network services and minimizing network configuration errors.OpenDaylight Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) is an application that provides multi-tenant virtual network on an SDN controller. It provides API for creating a common virtual network irrespective of the physical network.

It is implemented as two major components

* <<_vtn_coordinator>>
* <<_vtn_manager>>

===== VTN Coordinator

The VTN coordinator is an external application that provides a REST interface to user to use the VTN Virtualization. It interacts with VTN Manager plugin to implement the user configuration. It is also capable of multiple controller orchestration.realizes Virtual Tenant Network (VTN) provisioning in OpenDaylight Controllers (ODC). In the OpenDaylight architecture VTN Coordinator is part of the network application, orchestration and services layer. VTN Co ordinator has been implemented as an external application to the OpenDaylight controller. This component is responsible for the VTN virtualization. VTN Coordinator will use the REST interface exposed by the VTN Manger to realize the virtual network using the OpenDaylight controller. It uses OpenDaylight APIs (REST) to construct the virtual network in ODCs. It provides REST APIs for northbound VTN applications and supports virtual networks spanning across multiple ODCs by coordinating across ODCs.

VTN Co ordinator has the following components:

* VTN API - VTN Web API module provides the north bound REST API interface for VTN applications. For more information about VTN API, see <<_vtn_service_java_api_library>>.
* Transaction Co ordinator(TC) - The TC module is a two Phase commit coordinator module that provides the two phase commit coordination functionality for VTN coordinator components.
* Unified Provider Physical Layer (UPPL) - The UPPL module is a physical network provisioning/monitoring module. This module is a sub component of the VTN coordinator and provides the physical network provisioning and monitoring functionality.
* Unified Provider Logical Layer (UPLL) - The UPLL is a virtual network provisioning/monitoring module. This module is a a sub component of the VTN coordinator and provides the Virtual network provisioning and monitoring functionality.
