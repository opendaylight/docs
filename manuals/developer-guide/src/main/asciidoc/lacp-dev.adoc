== LACP
==== Link Aggregation Control Protocol Overview
LACP feature can be used to aggregate multiple links between
Opendaylight controlled network switches and its directly
connected LACP enabled legacy switches or hosts operating in active mode.

LACP passively negotiates automatic bundling of multiple links to form
a single logical interface.
The logical interface is currently realised in the Opendaylight controlled
switches using Openflow (1.3) group table functionality.
The realisation of the logical interface can be other mean by providing
a pluggable extension to the LACP.

==== LACP Architecture
* *Inventory*
   ** Responsible for maintaining list of lacp supporting opendaylight
     controlled switches, list of logical interfaces created and physical
     links that are part of the logical interfaces.
* *PacketHandler*
   ** Responsible for receiving and transmitting LACP PDUs to the
     LACP enabled endpoint 
* *Core*
   ** Responsible for the LACP state machine processing.

==== Realizing logical interface in switches

===== Group Table programming
The logical interface representing the aggregated multiple physical links
are realized in the opendaylight controlled switches by creating a 
group table entry (supported from Openflow 1.3).
The group table entry has a group type *Select* and Action referring to
the aggregated physical links.
Any data traffic to be sent out through the logical interface can be sent
through the *Group entry* available for the logical interface.

====== Alternate ways of realizing logical interface

An interface for the logical interface creation / modification / deletion
is provided by the LACP feature. The plugin to realize the logical interface
has to implement this interface and provide implementation for the following 
interface functions

* LACreateLag(nodeId, aggId, portId)

* LADeleteLag(nodeId, aggId)

* LAUpdateLag(nodeId, aggId, portId, action)

===== Realizing logical interface using other pluggable extension
The above mentioned interface implementations has to be provided by
the newly added pluggable extension. These functions must have a way
of informing the logical interface related operation to the switch.
It also has to provide a mapping so as to handle the data 
traffic transmitted through the logical interface using the hardware
support available for that logical interface in the switch.
