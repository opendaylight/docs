== OpenDaylight Overview
The OpenDaylight project is a collaborative open source project that
aims to accelerate adoption of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and
Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) with a transparent approach that
fosters new innovation.

OpenDaylight mainly consists of software designed to be run on top of a
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can be run on any operating system and
hardware as there is a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) available for it.

// TODO: uncomment the following lines when we have them to the point we think they're useful.
// OpenDaylight makes use of the following third-party tools:
//
// * *Maven*: OpenDaylight uses Maven for easier build automation. Maven uses pom.xml
// (Project Object Model) to script the dependencies between bundles.
//
// * *OSGi*: OSGi framework is the back-end of OpenDaylight as it allows dynamically
// loading bundles and packages JAR files, and binding bundles together for exchanging
// information.
//
// * *JAVA interfaces*: Java interfaces are usually generated by compiling the YANG project. Java interfaces are used for event listening, specifications, and forming
// patterns. This is the main way in which specific bundles implement call-back functions for events and also to indicate awareness of specific state.
//
// * *REST APIs*: Most of the REST APIs in OpenDaylight are defined using YANG tools and are RESTCONF APIs.
//
// * *Karaf*: TBD
