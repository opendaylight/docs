== Getting and Installing OpenDaylight

=== Downloading and installing OpenDaylight

The default distribution can be found on the OpenDaylight software
download page: http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads

The Karaf distribution has no features enabled by default. However, all
of the features are available to be installed.

NOTE: For compatibility reasons, you cannot enable all the features
simultaneously. We try to document known incompatibilities
<<_installing_the_components,below>>.

==== Running the karaf distribution
To run the Karaf distribution:

. Unzip the zip file.
. Navigate to the directory.
. run `./bin/karaf`.

For Example:

==== Listing available features
To find the complete list of Karaf features, run the following command:

----
feature:list
----

To list the installed Karaf features, run the following command:

----
feature:list -i
----

// Commenting out this section until we can actually provide some content.
//
// === Verifying your installation
// TBD

=== Installing support for REST APIs
Most components that offer REST APIs will automatically load the RESTCONF API Support
component, but if for whatever reason they seem to be missing, you can activate this
support by installing the `odl-restconf` feature.

// Commenting out this section until we can actually provide a tutorial that a
// user could follow
//
// === Making RESTCONF calls
// RESTCONF is a protocol that provides a programmatic interface over HTTP to access data that is defin
// ed in a YANG model and stored in data stores defined in the NETCONF protocol.
// RESTCONF protocol is implemented in `sal-rest-connector` artifact that is packed with the Karaf bundle.
// For more information on the RESTCONF protocol, refer to http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bierman-net
// conf-restconf-02
//
// RESTCONF allows access to datastores in the controller.
// The datastores available are:
//
// * config - contains data inserted using controller
// * operational - contains other data
//
// ==== Making a RESCONF call using cURL
//
// TBD

// Commenting this out as it appears to be out of date and there is already
// information about installing and using DLUX above.
//
//=== Installing the DLUX web interface
//
//The OpenDaylight web interface; DLUX, draws information from topology and host databases to display information about the topology of the network,
//flow statistics, host locations. You can either use DLUX as a stand-alone plug-in or integrate with OpenDaylight.
//To install DLUX as a standalone application, refer to  https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_DLUX:Setup_and_Run
//To integrate with OpenDaylight you must enable DLUX Karaf feature. You can enable AD-SAL, MD-SAL and various other bundles within Karaf depending on the features you
//would like to access using DLUX. Each feature can be enabled or disabled separately.
//
//[IMPORTANT]
//Ensure that you have created a topology and enabled MD-SAL feature in the Karaf distribution before you use DLUX for network management.
//For more information about enabling the Karaf features for DLUX, refer to https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_DLUX:DLUX_Karaf_Feature

=== Installing MD-SAL clustering
The MD-SAL clustering feature has "special" compatibility criteria. You *must*
install clustering, before other features are installed. To install clustering,
run the following command on the Karaf CLI console:

----
feature:install odl-mdsal-clustering
----

// Commenting out this section until we can actually provide a tutorial that
// walks through getting everything set up. Maybe we should just point to the
// L2 Switch docs?
//
// === Getting started with OpenFlow and Mininet
//
// ==== Downloading and installing Mininet
//
// Mininet downloads are available at: http://mininet.org
//
// The OVS version must be 2.1 or earlier.
//
// The instructions for installation are available at: http://mininet.org.
//
// ===== Verifying mininet installation
// To verify your mininet installation run the following command:
// `test=pingall`
//
// ----
// odluser@odl-vm:~\$ sudo mn --test=pingall
// *** Creating network
// *** Adding controller
// *** Adding hosts:

//
// ==== Enabling the OpenFlow plugin and L2 Switch
//
// To enable these features, run:
//
// ----
// feature:install odl-l2switch-switch-ui
// ----
//
// This will install the OpenFlow plugin and the L2 Switch application.
//
// ==== Running Mininet using OpenDaylight as the controller
