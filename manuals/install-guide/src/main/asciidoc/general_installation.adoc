== Getting and Installing OpenDaylight Helium

=== Downloading the Karaf Distribution

// ==== Getting the Default Distribution

The default distribution can be found on the OpenDaylight Software Download page here: http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads

This distribution comes with no features enabled by default, but all
features are able to be installed and run.

CAUTION: Not all features can be run at the same time without negative
         consequences.

// ==== Using the Custom Distribution Download Tool

// Fill in info once this exists.

=== Running the Karaf distribution

=== Installing Components

The following table describes a list of components in OpenDaylight Helium and the relevant Karaf feature to install in order to enable that component. To install a feature use the +feature:install+ Karaf command, for example:

-----
feature:install <feature-name>
-----

Multiple features can be installed in the same command:

-----
feature:install <feature1-name> <feature2-name> ... <featureN-name>

|=======================

In the table a compatibility value of "all" means that it can be run with any other features. A value of "self+all" indicates that the feature can be installed with anything with a value of "all", but not any other features with a value of "self+all".

==== Installing the DLUX Web Interface

The OpenDaylight Web Interface, DLUX, draws information from the OpenFlow Flow Programming and L2 Switch components to display information about the topology of the network, flow statistics, host locations and the like. It will automatically be installed when you install either of these components.

==== Installing support for REST APIs

Most components that offer REST APIs will automatically load the RESTCONF API Support component, but if for whatever reason they seem to be missing, you can activate this support by installing the +odl-restconf+ feature.

==== Installing MD-SAL Clustering

The MD-SAL clustering feature is noted to have "special" compatibility. It *must* be installed first, before any other features. That is, the first command run at the Karaf CLI should be:

----
feature:install odl-mdsal-clustering
----

==== Listing Available and Installed Karaf Features

Note, that this is not an exhaustive list of Karaf features, however you can find a full list by running the following command at the Karaf CLI:

----
feature:list
----

To just list the installed Karaf features, run the command:

----
feature:list -i
----

=== Project-Specific Installation Instructions

The Defense4All and Yang Tools projects provide project-specific installation instructions here. Other projects can either be installed by simply installing the appropriate Karaf feature(s) or, in some cases, further instructions can be found in the User Guide or Developer Guide.

=== Further Information

Further information can be found in the User Guide and Developer Guide, which should be available in the same location as this guide.
