== Table Type Patterns

Once the karaf distribution is downloaded and running, it is suggested that you install the +odl-ttp-model-rest+ feature. This will implicitly install the following features:

* +odl-restconf+
* +odl-mdsal-broker+
* +odl-mdsal-apidocs+
* +odl-ttp-model+

This can be done at the Karaf CLI with the following command:

 feature:install odl-ttp-model-rest

Technically, the +odl-restconf+, +odl-mdsal-broker+, and +odl-mdsal-apidocs+ features are not required, but they enable you to verify the installation has worked and provide REST interfaces.
