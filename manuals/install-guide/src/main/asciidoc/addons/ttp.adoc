== Table Type Patterns

Once the karaf distribution is downloaded and running, it is suggested that you install the following features:

* +standard+
* +odl-restconf+
* +odl-mdsal-broker+
* +odl-mdsal-apidocs+
* +odl-ttp-model+

This can be done as a single command at the Karaf CLI:

+feature:install standard odl-restconf odl-mdsal-broker odl-mdsal-apidocs odl-ttp-model+

Technically, the +odl-restconf+ and  +odl-mdsal-apidocs+ features are not required for operation, but they enable you to verify the installation has worked and provide REST interfaces.
