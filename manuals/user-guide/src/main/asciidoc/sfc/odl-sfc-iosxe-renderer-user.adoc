:SFCIOSXERNDR: SFC IOS-XE renderer

==== Overview
Early Service Function Chaining (SFC) renderer for IOS-XE devices
({SFCIOSXERNDR}) implements Service Chaining functionality on IOS-XE
capable switches. It listens for the creation of a Rendered Service
Path (RSP) and setup Service Function Forwarders (SFF) that are hosted
on IOS-XE switches to steer traffic through the service chain.

Common acronyms used in the following sections:

* SF - Service Function
* SFF - Service Function Forwarder
* SFC - Service Function Chain
* SP - Service Path
* SFP - Service Function Path
* RSP - Rendered Service Path
* LSF - Local Service Forwarder
* RSF - Remote Service Forwarder

==== SFC IOS-XE Renderer Architecture
When {SFCIOSXERNDR} is initialized, all required listeners are registered
to handle incoming data. It involves CSR/IOS-XE +NodeListener+ which stores
data about all configurable devices including their mountpoints (used here
as databrokers), +ServiceFunctionListener+, +ServiceForwarderListener+
(see mapping) and +RenderedPathListener+ used to listen for
RSP changes. When the {SFCIOSXERNDR} is invoked, +RenderedPathListener+ calls
the +IosXeRspProcessor+ which processes the RSP change and creates all necessary
Service Paths and Remote Service Forwarders (if necessary) on IOS-XE devices.

==== Service Path details
Each Service Path is defined by index (represented by NSP) and contains
service path entries. Each entry has appropriate service index
(NSI) and definition of next hop. Next hop can be Service Function, different
Service Function Forwarder or definition of end of chain - terminate. After
terminate, packet is sent to destination. If SFF is defined as a next hop,
it has to be present on device in the form of Remote Service Forwarder.
RSF-s are also created during RSP processing.

Example of Service Path:

service-chain service-path 200
   service-index 255 service-function firewall-1
   service-index 254 service-function dpi-1
   service-index 253 terminate

==== Mapping to IOS-XE SFC entities
Renderer contains mappers for SF-s and SFF-s. IOS-XE capable device is using its
own definition of Service Functions and Service Function Forwarders according to
appropriate .yang file.
+ServiceFunctionListener+ serves as a listener for SF changes. If SF appears in
datastore, listener extracts its management ip address and looks into cached IOS-XE
nodes. If some of available nodes match, Service function is mapped
in +IosXeServiceFunctionMapper+ to be understandable by IOS-XE device and it's
written into device's config.
+ServiceForwarderListener+ is used in a similar way. All SFF-s with suitable
management ip address it mapped in +IosXeServiceForwarderMapper+. Remapped SFF-s
are configured as a Local Service Forwarders. It is not possible to directly create
Remote Service Forwarder using IOS-XE renderer. RSF is created only during RSP processing.

==== Administering {SFCIOSXERNDR}
To use the SFC IOS-XE Renderer Karaf, at least the following Karaf
features must be installed:

* odl.aaa.shiro
* odl-sfc-model
* odl-sfc-provider
* odl-restconf
* odl-netconf-topology
* odl-sfc-ios-xe-renderer

==== {SFCIOSXERNDR} Tutorial

===== Overview
This tutorial is a simple example how to create Service Path on IOS-XE capable device
using IOS-XE renderer

===== Preconditions
To connect to IOS-XE device, is necessary to use several modified yang models and override
device's ones. All .yang files are in Yang/netconf folder in sfc-ios-xe-renderer module in
SFC project. These files have to be copied to sfc-karaf/target/assembly/cache/schema, before
karaf is started. After that, custom capabilities have to be send to network-topology:

===== Instructions
When IOS-XE renderer is installed, all netconf nodes in topology-netconf are
processed and all capable nodes with accessible mountpoints are cached.
First step is to create LSF on node.

+Service Function Forwarder configuration+

----

PUT ./config/service-function-forwarder:service-function-forwarders

{
    "service-function-forwarders": {
        "service-function-forwarder": [
            {
                "name": "CSR1Kv-2",
                "ip-mgmt-address": "172.25.73.23",
                "sff-data-plane-locator": [
                    {
                        "name": "CSR1Kv-2-dpl",
                        "data-plane-locator": {
                            "transport": "service-locator:vxlan-gpe",
                            "port": 6633,
                            "ip": "10.99.150.10"
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
----

If IOS-XE node with appropriate management ip exists, this configuration
is mapped and LSF is created on the device. Same approach is for
Service Functions.

----

PUT ./config/service-function:service-functions

{
    "service-functions": {
        "service-function": [
            {
                "name": "Firewall",

                        "transport": "service-locator:gre",
                        "service-function-forwarder": "CSR1Kv-2"
                    }

                        "name": "dpi-dpl",
                        "port": 6633,

                        "service-function-forwarder": "CSR1Kv-2"
                    }
                ]
            },
            {
                "name": "Qos",
                "ip-mgmt-address": "172.25.73.23",
                "type":"service-function-type: qos",

                "sf-data-plane-locator": [

                        "ip": "12.1.1.4",
                        "transport": "service-locator:gre",
                        "service-function-forwarder": "CSR1Kv-2"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}

----

All these SF-s are configured on the same device as the LSF. Next step is to
prepare Service Function Chain. SFC is symmetric.

----

PUT ./config/service-function-chain:service-function-chains/

{
    "service-function-chains": {
        "service-function-chain": [
            {
                "name": "CSR3XSF",
                "symmetric": "true",
                "sfc-service-function": [
                    {
                        "name": "Firewall",
                        "type": "service-function-type: firewall"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Dpi",
                        "type": "service-function-type: dpi"
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Qos",
                        "type": "service-function-type: qos"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
----

Service Function Path:

----

PUT ./config/service-function-path:service-function-paths/

{
    "service-function-paths": {
        "service-function-path": [
            {
                "name": "CSR3XSF-Path",
                "service-chain-name": "CSR3XSF",
                "starting-index": 255,
                "symmetric": "true"
            }
        ]
    }
}
----

Without classifier, there is possibility to POST RSP directly.

----

POST ./operations/rendered-service-path:create-rendered-path

{
  "input": {
      "name": "CSR3XSF-Path-RSP",
      "parent-service-function-path": "CSR3XSF-Path",
      "symmetric": true
  }
}

---

The resulting configuration:

!
service-chain service-function-forwarder local
  ip address 10.99.150.10
!
service-chain service-function firewall
ip address 12.1.1.2
  encapsulation gre enhanced divert
!
service-chain service-function dpi
ip address 12.1.1.1
  encapsulation gre enhanced divert
!
service-chain service-function qos
ip address 12.1.1.4
  encapsulation gre enhanced divert

service-chain service-path 1
  service-index 255 service-function firewall
  service-index 254 service-function dpi
  service-index 253 service-function qos

  service-index 255 service-function qos
  service-index 254 service-function dpi
  service-index 253 service-function firewall
  service-index 252 terminate
!

----

Service Path 1 is direct, Service Path 2 is reversed. Path numbers may vary.
