=== SFC OpenFlow Layer 2 Renderer User Guide

==== Overview
The Service Function Chaining (SFC) OpenFlow Layer 2 Renderer (SFCOFL2)
implements Service Chaining on OpenFlow switches. It listens for the
creation of a Rendered Service Path (RSP), and once received it programs
Service Function Forwarders (SFF) that are hosted on OpenFlow capable
switches to steer packets through the service chain.

Common acronyms used in the following sections:

* SF - Service Function
* SFF - Service Function Forwarder
* SFC - Service Function Chain
* SFP - Service Function Path
* RSP - Rendered Service Path

==== SFC OpenFlow Renderer Architecture
The SFCOFL2 is invoked after a RSP is created using an MD-SAL listener
called +SfcL2RspDataListener+. Upon SFCOFL2 initialization, the
+SfcL2RspDataListener+ registers itself to listen for RSP changes.
When invoked, the +SfcL2RspDataListener+ processes the RSP and calls
the +SfcL2FlowProgrammerOFImpl+ to create the necessary flows in the
Service Function Forwarders configured in the RSP. Refer to the
following diagram for more details.

==== SFC OpenFlow Switch Flow pipeline
The SFC OpenFlow Renderer uses the following tables for its Flow pipeline:

* Table 0, Transport Ingress
* Table 1, Path Mapper
* Table 2,  Next Hop
* Table 10, Transport Egress

The OpenFlow Table Pipeline is intended to be generic to work for
all of the different encapsulations supported by SFC.

All of the tables are explained in detail in the following section.

The SFFs (SFF1 and SFF2), SFs (SF1), and topology used for the flow
tables in the following sections is as described in the following
diagram.

===== Transport Ingress Table detailed

The Transport Ingress table has an entry per expected tunnel transport
type to be received in a particular SFF, as established in the SFC
configuration.

Here is an example on SFF1, assuming VLAN is used for the SFF-SF, and the RSP
tunnel is MPLS:

.Table Transport Ingress
|===
|Priority |Match | Action

|256
|EtherType==0x8847 (MPLS unicast)
|Goto Table 1

|256
|EtherType==0x8100 (VLAN)
|Goto Table 1

|5
|Match Any
|Drop
|===

===== Path Mapper Table detailed
The Path Mapper table has an entry per expected tunnel transport info
to be received in a particular SFF, as established in the SFC
configuration. The tunnel transport info is used to determine the
RSP Path ID, and is stored in the OpenFlow Metadata.

Since most SF nodes wont support tunneling, the IP header DSCP field is
used to store the RSP Path Id. The RSP Path Id is written to the DSCP
field in the Transport Egress table for those packets sent to an SF.

Here is an example on SFF1, assuming the following details:

* VLAN ID 1000 is used for the SFF-SF
* The RSP Path 1 tunnel uses MPLS label 100 for ingress and 101 for egress
* The RSP Path 2 (symmetric downlink path) uses MPLS label 101 for ingress and 100 for egress

.Table Path Mapper
|===
|Priority |Match | Action

|256
|MPLS Label==100
|RSP Path=1, Pop MPLS, Goto Table 2

|256
|MPLS Label==101
|RSP Path=2, Pop MPLS, Goto Table 2

|256
|VLAN ID==1000, IP DSCP==1
|RSP Path=1, Pop VLAN, Goto Table 2

|256
|VLAN ID==1000, IP DSCP==2
|RSP Path=2, Pop VLAN, Goto Table 2

|5
|Match Any
|Drop
|===

===== Next Hop Table detailed
The Next Hop table uses the RSP Path Id and source MAC address to
determine the destination MAC address.

Here is an example on SFF1, assuming SFF1 is connected to SFF2 and
RSP Path 1 ingress packets come from external to SFC, for which
we donâ€™t have the source MAC address (MacSrc).

.Table Next Hop
|===
|Priority |Match | Action

|256
|RSP Path==1, MacSrc==SF1
|MacDst=SFF2, Goto Table 10

|256
|RSP Path==2, MacSrc==SF1
|Goto Table 10

|256
|RSP Path==2, MacSrc==SFF2
|MacDst=SF1, Goto Table 10

|246
|RSP Path==1
|MacDst=SF1, Goto Table 10

|5
|Match Any
|Drop
|===

===== Transport Egress Table detailed
The Transport Egress table prepares egress tunnel information and
sends the packets out.

Here is an example on SFF1, assuming VLAN is used for the SFF-SF, and the
RSP tunnel is MPLS:

.Table Transport Egress
|===
|Priority |Match | Action

|256
|RSP Path==1, MacDst==SF1
|Push VLAN ID 1000, Port=SF1

|256
|RSP Path==1, MacDst==SFF2
|Push MPLS Label 101, Port=SFF2

|256
|RSP Path==2, MacDst==SF1
|Push VLAN ID 1000, Port=SF1

|246
|RSP Path==2
|Push MPLS Label 100, Port=Ingress

|5
|Match Any
|Drop
|===

==== Administering SFCOFL2
To use the SFC OpenFlow Renderer Karaf, at least the following Karaf
features must be installed.

* odl-openflowplugin-all
* odl-sfc-core (includes odl-sfc-provider and odl-sfc-model)
* odl-sfcofl2
* odl-sfc-ui (optional)

The following command can be used to view all of the currently installed Karaf features:

 opendaylight-user@root>feature:list -i

Or, pipe the command to a grep to see a subset of the currently installed Karaf features:

 opendaylight-user@root>feature:list -i | grep sfc

To install a particular feature, use the Karaf `feature:install` command.

==== SFCOFL2 Tutorial

===== Overview
The following Network Topology diagram shows how to configure SFC to
create a Service Chain.

.SFC OpenFlow Renderer Typical Network Topology
image::sfc/sfcofl2_architecture_nwtopo.jpg["SFC OpenFlow Renderer Typical Network Topology",width=500]

===== Prerequisites
To use this example, SFF OpenFlow switches must be created and
connected as illustrated above. Additionally, The SFs must be
created and connected to the SFFs.

===== Target Environment
The target environment is not important, but this use-case was created
and only tested on Linux.

===== Instructions
The steps to use this tutorial are as follows. The referenced
configuration in the steps is listed in the following sections.

There are numerous ways to send the configuration. The following
configuration chapters, the appropriate `curl` command is shown for
each configuration to be sent, including the URL.

Steps to configure the SFCOFL2 tutorial:

. Send the `SF` RESTCONF configuration
. Send the `SFF` RESTCONF configuration
. Send the `SFC` RESTCONF configuration
. Send the `SFP` RESTCONF configuration
. Create the `RSP` with a RESTCONF RPC command

Once the configuration has been successfully created, query the
Rendered Service Paths with either the SFC UI or via RESTCONF.
Notice that the RSP is symetrical, so the following 2 RSPs will
be created:

* sfc-path1
* sfc-path1-Reverse

At this point the Service Chains have been created, and the OpenFlow
Switches are programmed to steer traffic through the Service Chain.
Traffic can now be injected from a client into the Service Chain.
To debug problems, the OpenFlow tables can be dumped with the following
commands, assuming SFF1 is called `s1` and SFF2 is called `s2`.

 sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13  dump-flows s1

 sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13  dump-flows s2

In all the following configuration sections, replace the `${JSON}`
string with the appropriate JSON configuration. Also, change the
`localhost` desintation in the URL accordingly.

====== Service Function configuration
The Service Function configuration can be sent with the following command:

 curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" --data '${JSON}' -X PUT --user admin:admin http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function:service-functions/
