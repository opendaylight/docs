=== SFC OpenFlow Renderer User Guide

==== Overview
The Service Function Chaining (SFC) OpenFlow Renderer (SFCOFL2)
implements Service Chaining on OpenFlow switches. It listens for the
creation of a Rendered Service Path (RSP), and once received it programs
Service Function Forwarders (SFF) that are hosted on OpenFlow capable
switches to steer packets through the service chain.

Common acronyms used in the following sections:

* SF - Service Function
* SFF - Service Function Forwarder
* SFC - Service Function Chain
* SFP - Service Function Path
* RSP - Rendered Service Path

==== SFC OpenFlow Renderer Architecture
The SFCOFL2 is invoked after a RSP is created using an MD-SAL listener
called +SfcL2RspDataListener+. Upon SFCOFL2 initialization, the
+SfcL2RspDataListener+ registers itself to listen for RSP changes.
When invoked, the +SfcL2RspDataListener+ processes the RSP and calls
the +SfcL2FlowProgrammerOFImpl+ to create the necessary flows in the
Service Function Forwarders configured in the RSP. Refer to the
following diagram for more details.

==== SFC OpenFlow Switch Flow pipeline
The SFC OpenFlow Renderer uses the following tables for its Flow pipeline:

* Table 0, Classifier
* Table 1, Transport Ingress
* Table 2, Path Mapper
* Table 3, Path Mapper ACL
* Table 4, Next Hop
* Table 10, Transport Egress

The OpenFlow Table Pipeline is intended to be generic to work for
all of the different encapsulations supported by SFC.

All of the tables are explained in detail in the following section.

The SFFs (SFF1 and SFF2), SFs (SF1), and topology used for the flow
tables in the following sections are as described in the following
diagram.

===== Classifier Table detailed

It is possible for the SFF to also act as a classifier. This table maps subscriber
traffic to RSPs, and is explained in detail in the classifier documentation.

If the SFF is not a classifier, then this table will just have a simple Goto
Table 1 flow.

===== Transport Ingress Table detailed

The Transport Ingress table has an entry per expected tunnel transport
type to be received in a particular SFF, as established in the SFC
configuration.

Here are two example on SFF1: one where the RSP ingress tunnel is MPLS assuming
VLAN is used for the SFF-SF, and the other where the RSP ingress tunnel is NSH
GRE (UDP port 4789):

|EtherType==0x0800,udp,tp_dst==4789 (IP v4)

===== Path Mapper Table detailed
The Path Mapper table has an entry per expected tunnel transport info
to be received in a particular SFF, as established in the SFC
configuration. The tunnel transport info is used to determine the
RSP Path ID, and is stored in the OpenFlow Metadata. This table is not
used for NSH, since the RSP Path ID is stored in the NSH header. 

For SF nodes that do not support NSH tunneling, the IP header DSCP field is
used to store the RSP Path Id. The RSP Path Id is written to the DSCP
field in the Transport Egress table for those packets sent to an SF.

Here is an example on SFF1, assuming the following details:

* VLAN ID 1000 is used for the SFF-SF
* The RSP Path 1 tunnel uses MPLS label 100 for ingress and 101 for egress
* The RSP Path 2 (symmetric downlink path) uses MPLS label 101 for ingress and 100 for egress

|256
|VLAN ID==1000, IP DSCP==2
|RSP Path=2, Pop VLAN, Goto Table 4

|5
|Match Any
|Goto Table 3
|===

===== Path Mapper ACL Table detailed
This table is only populated when PacketIn packets are received from the switch
for TcpProxy type SFs. These flows are created with an inactivity timer of 60
seconds and will be automatically deleted upon expiration.

===== Next Hop Table detailed
The Next Hop table uses the RSP Path Id and appropriate packet fields to
determine where to send the packet next. For NSH, only the NSP (Network
Services Path, RSP ID) and NSI (Network Services Index, next hop) fields
from the NSH header are needed to determine the VXLAN tunnel destination
IP. For VLAN or MPLS, then the source MAC address is used to determine
the destination MAC address.

Here are two examples on SFF1, assuming SFF1 is connected to SFF2. RSP Paths 1
and 2 are symmetric VLAN paths. RSP Paths 3 and 4 are symmetric NSH paths.
RSP Path 1 ingress packets come from external to SFC, for which we donâ€™t have
the source MAC address (MacSrc).

===== Transport Egress Table detailed
The Transport Egress table prepares egress tunnel information and
sends the packets out.

Here are two examples on SFF1. RSP Paths 1 and 2 are symmetric MPLS paths that
use VLAN for the SFF-SF. RSP Paths 3 and 4 are symmetric NSH paths. Since it is
assumed that switches used for NSH will only have one VXLANport, the NSH
packets are just sent back where they came from.

==== Administering SFCOFL2
To use the SFC OpenFlow Renderer Karaf, at least the following Karaf
features must be installed.

* odl-openflowplugin-nxm-extensions
* odl-openflowplugin-flow-services
* odl-sfc-provider
* odl-sfc-model
* odl-sfcofl2
* odl-sfc-ui (optional)

The following command can be used to view all of the currently installed Karaf features:

 opendaylight-user@root>feature:list -i

Or, pipe the command to a grep to see a subset of the currently installed Karaf features:

 opendaylight-user@root>feature:list -i | grep sfc

To install a particular feature, use the Karaf `feature:install` command.

==== SFCOFL2 Tutorial

===== Overview
In this tutorial, 2 different encapsulations will be shown: MPLS and NSH. The
following Network Topology diagram is a logical view of the SFFs and SFs involved
in creating the Service Chains.

.SFC OpenFlow Renderer Typical Network Topology
image::sfc/sfcofl2_architecture_nwtopo.jpg["SFC OpenFlow Renderer Typical Network Topology",width=500]

===== Prerequisites
To use this example, SFF OpenFlow switches must be created and
connected as illustrated above. Additionally, the SFs must be
created and connected.

===== Target Environment
The target environment is not important, but this use-case was created
and tested on Linux.

===== Instructions
The steps to use this tutorial are as follows. The referenced
configuration in the steps is listed in the following sections.

There are numerous ways to send the configuration. In the following
configuration chapters, the appropriate `curl` command is shown for
each configuration to be sent, including the URL.

Steps to configure the SFCOFL2 tutorial:

. Send the `SF` RESTCONF configuration
. Send the `SFF` RESTCONF configuration
. Send the `SFC` RESTCONF configuration
. Send the `SFP` RESTCONF configuration
. Create the `RSP` with a RESTCONF RPC command

Once the configuration has been successfully created, query the
Rendered Service Paths with either the SFC UI or via RESTCONF.
Notice that the RSP is symmetrical, so the following 2 RSPs will
be created:

* sfc-path1
* sfc-path1-Reverse

At this point the Service Chains have been created, and the OpenFlow
Switches are programmed to steer traffic through the Service Chain.
Traffic can now be injected from a client into the Service Chain.
To debug problems, the OpenFlow tables can be dumped with the following
commands, assuming SFF1 is called `s1` and SFF2 is called `s2`.

 sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13  dump-flows s1

 sudo ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13  dump-flows s2

In all the following configuration sections, replace the `${JSON}`
string with the appropriate JSON configuration. Also, change the
`localhost` desintation in the URL accordingly.
