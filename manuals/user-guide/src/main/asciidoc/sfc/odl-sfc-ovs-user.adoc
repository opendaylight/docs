=== SFC-OVS integration

==== Overview
SFC-OVS provides integration of SFC with OpenVSwitch (OVS) devices.
Integration is realized through mapping of SFC objects (like SF, SFF,
Classifier, etc.) to OVS objects (like Bridge, TerminationPoint=Port/Interface).
The mapping takes care of automatic instantiation (setup) of corresponding objects
whenever it's opossite is created. E.g. new SFF --create-- > OVS Bridge, new OVS
Bridge --create-- > SFF, etc.

The feature is intended for SFC users willing to use OpenVSwitch as underlying
network infrastructure for deploying RSPs (Rendered Service Paths).

==== SFC-OVS Architecture
SFC-OVS uses OVSDB MDSAL Southbound API for getting/writing information from/to
OVS devices. From the user perspective SFC-OVS acts as a layer between SFC
DataStore and OVSDB.

==== Configuring SFC-OVS
.Configuration steps:
. Run ODL distribution (run karaf)
. In karaf console execute: feature:install odl-sfc-ovs
. Configure OpenVSwitch to use ODL as a manager, using following command:
+ovs-vsctl set-manager tcp:<odl_ip_address>:6640

==== Tutorials

===== Verifying mapping from OVS to SFF

====== Overview
This tutorial shows the usual workflow when OVS configuration is transformed to
corresponding SFC objects (in this case SFF).

====== Prerequisities
* OpenVSwitch installed (ovs-vsctl command available in shell)
* SFC-OVS feature configured as stated above

====== Instructions
.In shell execute:
. +ovs-vsctl set-manager tcp:<odl_ip_address>:6640+
. +ovs-vsctl add-br br1+
. +ovs-vsctl add-port br1 testPort+

====== Verification
.There are two possible ways to verify if SFF was created:
a. visit +http://<odl_ip_address>:8181/sfc/index.html#/sfc/serviceforwarder+
b. use pure RESTconf and send GET request to URL:
+http://<odl_ip_address>:8181/restconf/config/service-function-forwarder:service-function-forwarders+

There should be SFF, which name will be ending with 'br1' and the SFF should
containt two DataPlane locators: 'br1' and 'testPort'.

===== Verifying mapping from SFF to OVS

====== Overview
This tutorial shows the usual workflow during creation of OVS Bridge with use
of SFC APIs.

====== Prerequisities
* OpenVSwitch installed (ovs-vsctl command available in shell)
* SFC-OVS feature configured as stated above

====== Instructions
.Steps:
. In shell execute: +ovs-vsctl set-manager tcp:<odl_ip_address>:6640+
. Send POST request to URL:
+http://<odl_ip_address>:8181/restconf/operations/service-function-forwarder-ovs:create-ovs-bridge+
Use Basic auth with credentials: "admin", "admin" and set +Content-Type: application/json+.
The content of POST request should be following:
----
{
    "input":
    {
        "name": "br-test",
        "ovs-node": {
            "ip": "<OpenVSwitch_ip_address>"
        }
    }
}
----
OpenVSwitch_ip_address is IP address of machine, where OpenVSwitch is installed.

====== Verification
In shell execute: +ovs-vsctl show+. There should be Bridge with name 'br-test'
and one port/interface called 'br-test'.

Also, corresponding SFF for this OVS Bridge should be configured, what can be
verified through SFC-UI or RESTconf as stated in previous tutorial.
