=== Service Function Scheduling Algorithms

==== Overview
When creating the Rendered Service Path, the origin SFC controller chose
the first available service function from a list of service function names.
This may result in many issues such as overloaded service functions
and a longer service path as SFC has no means to understand the status of
service functions and network topology. The service function selection
framework supports at least four algorithms (Random, Round Robin,
Load Balancing and Shortest Path) to select the most appropriate service
function when instantiating the Rendered Service Path. In addition, it is an
extensible framework that allows 3rd party selection algorithm to be plugged in.

==== Architecture
The following figure illustrates the service function selection framework
and algorithms.

.SF Selection Architecture
image::sfc/sf-selection-arch.png["SF Selection Architecture",width=500]

A user has three different ways to select one service function selection
algorithm:

. Integrated RESTCONF Calls. OpenStack and/or other administration system
  could provide plugins to call the APIs to select one scheduling algorithm.
. Command line tools. Command line tools such as curl or browser plugins
  such as POSTMAN (for Google Chrome) and RESTClient (for Mozilla Firefox)
  could select schedule algorithm by making RESTCONF calls.
. SFC-UI. Now the SFC-UI provides an option for choosing a selection algorithm
  when creating a Rendered Service Path.

The RESTCONF northbound SFC API provides GUI/RESTCONF interactions for choosing
the service function selection algorithm.
MD-SAL data store provides all supported service function selection algorithms,
and provides APIs to enable one of the provided service function selection
algorithms.  
Once a service function selection algorithm is enabled, the service function
selection algorithm will work when creating a Rendered Service Path. 

==== Select SFs with Scheduler
Administrator could use both the following ways to select one of the selection
algorithm when creating a Rendered Service Path.

* Command line tools. Command line tools includes Linux commands curl or even
   browser plugins such as POSTMAN(for Google Chrome) or RESTClient(for Mozilla
   Firefox). In this case, the following JSON content is needed at the moment:
   Service_function_schudule_type.json
+
 {
   "service-function-scheduler-types": {
     "service-function-scheduler-type": [
       {
         "name": "random",
         "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:random",
         "enabled": false
       },
       {
         "name": "roundrobin",
         "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:round-robin",
         "enabled": true
       },
       {
         "name": "loadbalance",
         "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:load-balance",
         "enabled": false
       },
       {
         "name": "shortestpath",
         "type": "service-function-scheduler-type:shortest-path",
         "enabled": false
       }
     ]
   }
 }
+
If using the Linux curl command, it could be:
+
 curl -i -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Cache-Control: no-cache" --data '$${Service_function_schudule_type.json}'
 -X PUT --user admin:admin http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/service-function-scheduler-type:service-function-scheduler-types/
+
Here is also a snapshot for using the RESTClient plugin:

.Mozilla Firefox RESTClient

* SFC-UI.SFC-UI provides a drop down menu for service function selection
  algorithm. Here is a snapshot for the user interaction from SFC-UI when
  creating a Rendered Service Path.

.Karaf Web UI
image::sfc/karaf-webui-select-a-type.png["Karaf Web UI",width=500]
NOTE: Some service function selection algorithms in the drop list are not
      implemented yet. Only the first three algorithms are committed at the
      moment.

===== Random
Select Service Function from the name list randomly.

====== Overview
The Random algorithm is used to select one Service Function from the name list
which it gets from the Service Function Type randomly.

====== Prerequisites
* Service Function information are stored in datastore.
* Either no algorithm or the Random algorithm is selected.

====== Target Environment
The Random algorithm will work either no algorithm type is selected or the
Random algorithm is selected.

====== Instructions
Once the plugins are installed into Karaf successfully, a user can use his
favorite method to select the Random scheduling algorithm type.
There are no special instructions for using the Random algorithm.

===== Round Robin
Select Service Function from the name list in Round Robin manner.

====== Overview
The Round Robin algorithm is used to select one Service Function from the name
list which it gets from the Service Function Type in a Round Robin manner, this
will balance workloads to all Service Functions. However, this method cannot
help all Service Functions load the same workload because it's flow-based
Round Robin.

====== Prerequisites
* Service Function information are stored in datastore.
* Round Robin algorithm is selected

====== Target Environment
The Round Robin algorithm will work one the Round Robin algorithm is selected.

====== Instructions
Once the plugins are installed into Karaf successfully, a user can use his
favorite method to select the Round Robin scheduling algorithm type.
There are no special instructions for using the Round Robin algorithm.

===== Load Balance Algorithm
Select appropriate Service Function by actual CPU utilization.

====== Overview
The Load Balance Algorithm is used to select appropriate Service Function
by actual CPU utilization of service functions. The CPU utilization of
service function obtained from monitoring information reported via NETCONF.

====== Prerequisites
* CPU-utilization for Service Function.
* NETCONF server.
* NETCONF client.
* Each VM has a NETCONF server and it could work with NETCONF client well.

====== Instructions
Set up VMs as Service Functions. enable NETCONF server in VMs.
Ensure that you specify them separately. For example:

.1 *Setting up the VM*
.. Set up 4 VMs include 2 SFs' type are Firewall, Others are Napt44. Name them
   as firewall-1, firewall-2, napt44-1, napt44-2 as Service Function.
   The four VMs can run either the same server or different servers.
.. Install NETCONF server on every VM and enable it.
   More information on NETCONF can be found on the OpenDaylight wiki here:
   https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Config:Examples:Netconf:Manual_netopeer_installation
.. Get Monitoring data from NETCONF server.
   These monitoring data should be get from the NETCONF server which is running
   in VMs. The following static XML data is an example:

.2 *Start SFC*
.. Unzip SFC release tarball.
.. Run SFC: ${SFC}/bin/karaf.
More information on Service Function Chaining can be found on the OpenDaylight
SFC's wiki page:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Service_Function_Chaining:Main

.3 *Verify the Load Balance Algorithm*
.. Deploy the SFC2 (firewall-abstract2=>napt44-abstract2) and click button to
   Create Rendered Service Path in SFC UI (http://localhost:8181/sfc/index.html).
.. Verify the Rendered Service Path to ensure the CPU utilization of the
   selected hop is the minimum one among all the service functions with same
   type.
The correct RSP is firewall-1=>napt44-2

===== Shortest Path Algorithm
Select appropriate Service Function by Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's
algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a
graph.

====== Overview
The Shortest Path Algorithm is used to select appropriate Service Function by
actual topology.

====== Prerequisites

* Dijkstra's algorithm. More information on Dijkstra's algorithm can be found
on the wiki here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

====== Instructions

.. Unzip SFC release tarball.
.. Run SFC: ${SFC}/bin/karaf.
.. Depoly SFFs and SFs. import the service-function-forwarders.json and
   service-functions.json in UI (http://localhost:8181/sfc/index.html#/sfc/config)

.2 *Verify the Shortest Path Algorithm*
** Deploy the SFC2(firewall-abstract2=>napt44-abstract2), select "Shortest
   Path" as schedule type and click button to Create Rendered Service Path in
   SFC UI (http://localhost:8181/sfc/index.html).

.select schedule type
image::sfc/sf-schedule-type.png["select schedule type",width=500]

** Verify the Rendered Service Path to ensure the selected hops are linked in
   one SFF. The correct RSP is firewall-1=>napt44-1 or  firewall-2=>napt44-2.
   The first SF type is Firewall in Service Function Chain. So the algorithm
   will select first Hop randomly among all the SFs type is Firewall.
   Assume the first selected SF is firewall-2. 
   All the path from firewall-1 to SF which type is Napt44 are list:

* Path1: firewall-2 -> sff2 -> napt44-2
* Path2: firewall-2 -> sff2 -> sff3 -> sff1 -> napt44-1
