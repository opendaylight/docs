== Neutron Service User Guide

=== Overview
This karaf feature provides integration support for OpenStack Neutron
via the ODL ML2 mechanism driver. Neutron Service is only one of the
components necessary for openstack integration. For those related component
please refer to documentations of each components.

==== Use cases and who will use the feature
If you want openstack integration with OpenDayLight, you will need
this feature with ODL provider feature like ovsdb/netvirt, group based
policy, VTN, and lisp mapper. For provider configuration, please refer
to each documentation. Since Neutron service only provides northbound
API for openstack neutron ML2 mechanism driver. Without those provider
feature, neutron service itself isn't useful.

=== Neutron Service feature Architecture
Neutron service provides northbound API for openstack neutron via
RESTCONF and also its dedicated REST API.
it communicates through its yang-model with providers.

=== Configuring Neutron Service feature
As the karaf feature includes everything necessary for communicating
northbound, no special configuration is needed.
Usually this feature is used with ODL southbound plugin that implements
actual network virtualization functionality and openstack neutron.
The user wants to setup those configurations. Refer to each related
documentations for each configurations.

=== Administering or Managing odl-neutron-service
There is no specific configuration regarding to neutron service itself.
For related configuration, please refer to openstack neutron configuration
and opendaylight related services which are provider for openstack.

==== installing odl-neutron-service while the controller running

. While OpenDayLight is running, in Karaf prompt, type:
  feature:install odl-neutron-service.
. Wait a while until the initialization is done and the controller stabilizes.


odl-neutron-services provides only unified interface for openstack neutron.
It doesn't provide actual functionality for network virtualization.
Refer to each ODL project documentation for actual configuration with
openstack neutron.


=== Neutron Logger
another service neutron-logger is provided for debugging/logging purpose.
It logs changes on Neutron YANG models.

  feature:install odl-neutron-logger
