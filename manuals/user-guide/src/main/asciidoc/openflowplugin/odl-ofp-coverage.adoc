===== Intro

This page is to catalog the things that have been tested and confirmed
to work:

===== Coverage
Coverage has been moved to a link:https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AtpUuSEP8OyMdHNTZjBoM0VjOE9BcGhHMzk3N19uamc&usp=sharing%23gid=2#gid=0[GoogleDoc Spreadshee]

===== OF 1.3 Considerations

The baseline model is a OF 1.3 model, and the coverage tables primarily
deal with OF 1.3. However for OF 1.0, we have a column to indicate
either N/A if it doesn't apply, or whether its been confirmed working.

===== OF 1.0 Considerations

OF 1.0 is being considered as a switch with:
* 1 Table
* 0 Groups
* 0 Meters
* 1 Instruction (Apply Actions)
* and a limited vocabulary of matches and actions.
