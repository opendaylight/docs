[[of-1.3-considerations]]
==== OF 1.3 Considerations

The baseline model is a OF 1.3 model, and the coverage tables primarily
deal with OF 1.3. However for OF 1.0, we have a column to indicate
either N/A if it doesn't apply, or whether its been confirmed working.

[[of-1.0-considerations]]
==== OF 1.0 Considerations

OF 1.0 is being considered as a switch with:

* 1 Table
* 0 Groups
* 0 Meters
* 1 Instruction (Apply Actions)
* and a limited vocabulary of matches and actions.
