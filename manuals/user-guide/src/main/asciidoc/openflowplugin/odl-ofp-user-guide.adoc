=== Web / Graphical Interface
In the Hydrogen & Helium release, the current Web UI does not support
the new OpenFlow 1.3 constructs such as groups, meters, new fields in
the flows, multiple flow tables, etc.

=== Command Line Interface
The following is not exactly CLI - just a set of test commands which can
be executed on the OSGI console testing various features in OpenFlow 1.3
spec.

* <<odl-ofp-test-provider-meters_test-provider,OSGI Console Test Provider Commands: Meters>>
* <<odl-ofp-test-provider-topoogy_test-provider,OSGI Console Test Provider Commands: Topology Events>>
