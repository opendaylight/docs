====== Learn End to End for Inventory

====== Check inventory

* Run mininet with support for OF 1.3 as described in
<<odl-ofp-end-to-end-inventory_introduction-introduction,End to End Inventory>>
* Make sure you see the openflow:1 node come up as described in
<<odl-ofp-end-to-end-inventory_introduction-introduction,End to End Inventory>>

[[meter-strategy]]
====== Meter Strategy

Current way to flush a meter to switch looks like this: 

. create MD-SAL modeled flow and commit it into dataStore using two
phase commit
. FRM gets notified and invokes corresponding rpc (addMeter) on
particular service provider (if suitable provider for given node
registered)
. the provider (plugin in this case) transforms MD-SAL modeled meter
into OF-API modeled meter
. OF-API modeled meter is then flushed into OFLibrary
. OFLibrary encodes meter into particular version of wire protocol and
sends it to particular switch
. check on mininet side if meter is installed

[[push-your-meter]]
====== Push your Meter

* Using PostMan:
** Set Request Headers
*** Content-Type: application/xml
*** Accept: application/xml
** Use URL:
"http://:8080/restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/meter/1"
** Method:PUT
** Request Body:

[source, xml]
--------------------------------------------------------------
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
<meter xmlns="urn:opendaylight:flow:inventory">
    <container-name>abcd</container-name>
    <flags>meter-burst</flags>
    <meter-band-headers>
        <meter-band-header>
            <band-burst-size>444</band-burst-size>
            <band-id>0</band-id>
            <band-rate>234</band-rate>
            <dscp-remark-burst-size>5</dscp-remark-burst-size>
            <dscp-remark-rate>12</dscp-remark-rate>
            <prec_level>1</prec_level>
            <meter-band-types>
                <flags>ofpmbt-dscp-remark</flags>
            </meter-band-types>
        </meter-band-header>
    </meter-band-headers>
    <meter-id>1</meter-id>
    <meter-name>Foo</meter-name>
</meter>
--------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: If you want to try a different meter id, make sure the URL
and the body stay in sync. For example, if you wanted to try: meter-id
20 you'd change the URL to "http://:8080/restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/meter/20" but you would also need to update the 20 in the body to match.

NOTE: :Provide the IP Address of the machine on which the
controller is running.

[[check-for-your-meter-on-the-switch]]
==== Check for your meter on the switch

* See your meter on your CPqD switch:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND: $ sudo dpctl tcp:127.0.0.1:6000 meter-config

SENDING:
stat_req{type="mconf", flags="0x0"{meter_id= ffffffff"}


RECEIVED:
stat_repl{type="mconf", flags="0x0", stats=[{meter= c"", flags="4", bands=[{type = dscp_remark, rate="12", burst_size="5", prec_level="1"}]}]}
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[[check-for-your-meter-in-the-controller-config-via-restconf]]
====== Check for your meter in the controller config via RESTCONF

* See your configured flow in POSTMAN with
** URL
"http://:8080/restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/meter/1"
** Method: GET
** You should no longer need to set Request Headers for Accept
** Note: :Provide the IP Address of the machine on which the controller
is running.

[[look-for-your-meter-stats-in-the-controller-operational-data-via-restconf]]
====== Look for your meter stats in the controller operational data via RESTCONF

* See your operational meter stats in POSTMAN with
** URL
"http://:8080/restconfig/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/meter/1"
** Method: GET
** Note: :Provide the IP Address of the machine on which the controller
is running.

[[discovering-and-testing-meter-types]]
===== Discovering and testing Meter Types

Currently, the openflowplugin has a test-provider that allows you to
push various meters through the system from the OSGI command line. Once
those meters have been pushed through, you can see them as examples and
then use them to see in the config what a particular meter example looks
like.

[[using-addmeter]]
====== Using addMeter

From the

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd openflowplugin/distribution/base/target/distributions-openflowplugin-base-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-osgipackage/opendaylight
./run.sh
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Point your CPqD at the controller as described above.

Once you can see your CPqD connected to the controller, at the OSGI
command line try running:

-------------------
addMeter openflow:1
-------------------

Once you've done that, use

* GET
* Accept: application/xml
* URL:
"http://:8080/restconf/config/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/meter/12"
** Note: :Provide the IP Address of the machine on which the controller
is running.

NOTE: Before attempting to PUT a meter you have created via addMeter,
please change its URL and body to, for example, use meter 1 instead of
meter 2 or another Meter Id, so you don't collide.

NOTE: There are several test command providers and the one handling
Meter is *OpenflowpluginMeterTestCommandProvider*. Methods, which can be
used as *commands in OSGI-console* have prefix '_'. Examples: addMeter,
modifyMeter and removeMeter.

[[example-meter]]
===== Example Meter

Examples for XML for various Meter Types can be found in the
test-scripts bundle of the plugin code with names m1.xml, m2.xml and
m3.xml.
