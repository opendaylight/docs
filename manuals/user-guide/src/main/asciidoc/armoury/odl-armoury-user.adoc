== Armoury
This section describes how to use the Armoury feature in OpenDaylight
and contains contains configuration, administration, and management
sections for the feature.

=== Overview
Just as compute needs to make requests to the controller to get networking
resources in order to provide its services, so too does the controller
sometimes need to make requests of the workload manager to get compute
resources and/or network function (NF) (physical or virtual) orchestration
to provide its services.

=== Armoury Architecture
There are mainly three components :

* *Armoury Catalog*
A registry or catalog of the necessary information (images, metadata, templatized
day 0 config, how to communicate with the NF, etc) to describe the NF to the
workload manager and/or network function (NF) (physical or virtual) orchestration.

* *Armoury Workload Manager*
The most minimal possible API to allow applications to request that the workload
manager start/stop/etc the NF and some information from the workload manager/nf
orchestrator about the state of the NF.

* *Armoury Driver Registry*
Example Drivers to talk to various workload managers (OpenStack/Meseophere/Docker/
Kubernetes/etc).

=== Armoury Catalog
The NF Catalog contains metadata describing a NF.

=== Armoury Driver Registry
The Driver Registry Describes the driver that is used to talk with the
workload manager (OpenStack/Meseophere/Docker/Kubernetes/etc).
