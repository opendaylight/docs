== Packet Cable MultiMedia (PCMM) Service

Packet Cable MultiMedia (PCMM) provides an interface to control and management service flow for CMTS network elements. A service flows constitute a DOCSIS data path between a CMTS and a subscriber's cable modem (CM) guaranteed application specific quality of service (QoS), known as Dynamic Quality of Service (DQoS). PCMM offers (MSOs) the ability to deliver new services using existing cable infrastructure. MSOs have already begun to apply PCMM technology for expanding their multimedia service offerings.

=== Overview

The PCMM architecture comprises the following components:

* The Application Manager, which specifies QoS requirements to the Policy Server on a per-application basis.
* The Policy Server, which allocates network resources per subscriber and per application, ensuring that consumption meets MSO priorities.
* The Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS), which enforces policies according to bandwidth capacity.
* The Cable Modem, which resides on the client side and connects the client's network to the cable system.

PacketCable Multimedia defines a service delivery framework that provides general-purpose QoS, event-based accounting, and security functionality founded upon the mechanisms defined in PacketCable 1.x. However, due to the broader spectrum of applications and services addressed by this initiative, each of these functional areas has been revisited and generalized for the present purposes. Telephony-specific requirements and interfaces (e.g., call signaling, PSTN interconnection and electronic surveillance) are not part of PacketCable Multimedia, while core functionality such as QoS resource management mechanisms, has been enhanced. Throughout this process, one of the primary objectives of this work has been to leverage and reuse as much of the existing body of PacketCable 1.x investment, knowledge base, and technical functionality as possible. Key features of the described Multimedia service delivery framework include:

* Simple, powerful access to DOCSIS QoS mechanisms supporting both time and volume-based network resource authorizations,
* Abstract, event-based network resource auditing and management mechanisms,
* A robust security infrastructure that provides integrity and appropriate levels of protection across all interfaces.

The goal of this project is to utilizes the OpenDayLight controller platform as for the Application Manager and parts of the Policy Server and leverage the as many existing components offered by the platform.

The initial southbound transport has been written to the following version of the specification: http://www.cablelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/specdocs/PKT-SP-MM-I05-091029.pdf
