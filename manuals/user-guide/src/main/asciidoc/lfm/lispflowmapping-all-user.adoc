== LISP Flow Mapping User Guide

=== Overview

==== Locator/ID Separation Protocol

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830[Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)] is a
technology that provides a flexible map-and-encap framework that can be used
for overlay network applications such as data center network virtualization and
Network Function Virtualization (NFV).

LISP provides the following name spaces:

* http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#page-6[Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)]
* http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-3[Routing Locators (RLOCs)]

In a virtualization environment EIDs can be viewed as virtual address space and
RLOCs can be viewed as physical network address space.

The LISP framework decouples network control plane from the forwarding plane by
providing:

* A data plane that specifies how the virtualized network addresses are
  encapsulated in addresses from the underlying physical network.
* A control plane that stores the mapping of the virtual-to-physical address
  spaces, the associated forwarding policies and serves this information to
  the data plane on demand.

Network programmability is achieved by programming forwarding policies such as
transparent mobility, service chaining, and traffic engineering in the mapping
system; where the data plane elements can fetch these policies on demand as new
flows arrive. This chapter describes the LISP Flow Mapping project in
OpenDaylight and how it can be used to enable advanced SDN and NFV use cases.

LISP data plane Tunnel Routers are available at
http://LISPmob.org/[LISPmob.org] in the open source community on the following
platforms:

* Linux
* Android
* OpenWRT

For more details and support for LISP data plane software please visit
http://LISPmob.org/[the LISPmob web site].

==== LISP Flow Mapping Service

The LISP Flow Mapping service provides LISP Mapping System services. This
includes LISP  Map-Server and LISP Map-Resolver services to store and serve
mapping data to data plane nodes as well as to OpenDaylight applications.
Mapping data can include mapping of virtual addresses to physical network
address where the virtual nodes are reachable or hosted at. Mapping data can
also include a variety of routing policies including traffic engineering and
load balancing. To leverage this service, OpenDaylight applications and
services can use the northbound REST API to define the mappings and policies in
the LISP Mapping Service. Data plane devices capable of LISP control protocol
can leverage this service through a southbound LISP plugin. LISP-enabled
devices must be configured to use this OpenDaylight service as their Map Server
and/or Map Resolver.

The southbound LISP plugin supports the LISP control protocol (Map-Register,
Map-Request, Map-Reply messages), and can also be used to register mappings in
the OpenDaylight mapping service.

=== LISP Flow Mapping Architecture

The following figure shows the various LISP Flow Mapping modules.

.LISP Mapping Service Internal Architecture

image::lispflow-technical-arch-overview-helium.jpg["LISP Mapping Service Internal Architecture", width=460]

A brief description of each module is as follows:

* *DAO (Data Access Object):* This layer separates the LISP logic from the
  database, so that we can separate the map server and map resolver from the
  specific implementation of the mapping database. Currently we have an
  implementation of this layer with an in-memory HashMap, but it can be switched
  to any other key/value store and you only need to implement the ILispDAO
  interface.

* *Map Server:* This module processes the adding or registration of
  authentication tokens (keys) and mappings. For a detailed specification of
  LISP Map Server, see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* *Map Resolver:* This module receives and processes the mapping lookup queries
  and provides the mappings to requester. For a detailed specification of LISP
  Map Server, see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* *Northbound API:* This is part of the OpenDaylight northbound API. This
  module enables defining key-EID associations as well as adding mapping
  information through the Map Server. Key-EID associations can also be queried
  via this API. The northbound API also provides capability of querying the
  mapping information for an EID prefix.
* *Neutron:* This module implements the OpenDaylight Neutron Service APIs. It
  provides integration between the LISP service and the OpenDaylight Neutron
  service, and thus OpenStack.
* *NETCONF:* This module enables the LISP service to communicate to
  NETCONF-enabled devices through OpenDaylight's NETCONF plugin.
* *Java API:* The API module exposes the Map Server and Map Resolver
  capabilities via a Java API.
* *LISP Southbound Plugin:* This plugin enables data plane devices that support
  LISP control plane protocol (see  see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP])
  to register and query mappings to the
  LISP Flow Mapping via the LISP control plane protocol.


=== Configuring LISP Flow Mapping

In order to use the LISP mapping service for registering EID to RLOC mappings
from northbound or southbound, keys have to be defined for the EID prefixes first. Once a key
is defined for an EID prefix, it can be used to add mappings for that EID
prefix multiple times. If the service is going to be used to process Map-Register
messages from the southbound LISP plugin, the same key must be used by
the data plane device to create the authentication data in the Map-Register
messages for the associated EID prefix.

The +etc/custom.properties+ file in the Karaf distribution allows configuration
of several OpenDaylight parameters.  The LISP service has two properties that
can be adjusted: +lisp.mappingOverwrite+ and +lisp.smr+.

*lisp.mappingOverwrite* (default: 'true')::
    Configures handling of mapping updates.  When set to 'true' (default) a
    mapping update (either through the southbound plugin via a Map-Register
    message or through a northbound API PUT REST call) the existing RLOC set
    associated to an EID prefix is overwritten.  When set to 'false', the RLOCs
    of the update are merged to the existing set.

*lisp.smr* (default: 'false')::
    Enables/disables the
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-6.6.2[Solicit-Map-Request (SMR)]
    functionality.  SMR is a method to notify changes in an EID-to-RLOC mapping
    to "subscribers".  The LISP service considers all Map-Request's source RLOC
    as a subscriber to the requested EID prefix, and will send an SMR control
    message to that RLOC if the mapping changes.

*lisp.elpPolicy* (default: 'default')::
    Configures how to build a Map-Reply southbound message from a mapping
    containing an Explicit Locator Path (ELP) RLOC.  It is used for
    compatibility with dataplane devices that don't understand the ELP LCAF
    format.  The 'default' setting doesn't alter the mapping, returning all
    RLOCs unmodified.  The 'both' setting adds a new RLOC to the mapping, with
    a lower priority than the ELP, that is the next hop in the service chain.
    To determine the next hop, it searches the source RLOC of the Map-Request
    in the ELP, and chooses the next hop, if it exists, otherwise it chooses
    the first hop.  The 'replace' setting adds a new RLOC using the same
    algorithm as the 'both' setting, but using the origin priority of the ELP
    RLOC, which is removed from the mapping.

=== Textual Conventions for LISP Address Formats

In addition to the more common IPv4, IPv6 and MAC address data types, the LISP
control plane supports arbitrary
http://www.iana.org/assignments/address-family-numbers[Address Family
Identifiers] assigned by IANA, and in addition to those the
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-lisp-lcaf[LISP Canoncal Address Format
(LCAF)].

The LISP Flow Mapping project in OopenDaylight implements support for many of
these different address formats, the full list being summarized in the
following table.  While some of the address formats have well defined and
widely used textual representation, many don't.  It became necessary to define
a convention to use for text rendering of all implemented address types in
logs, URLs, input fields, etc.  The below table lists the supported formats,
along with their AFI number and LCAF type, including the prefix used for
disambiguation of potential overlap, and examples output.

.LISP Address Formats
[align="right",options="header",cols="<s,>,>,<,<l"]
|=====
|         Name           |  AFI  | LCAF |  Prefix  |  Text Rendering

|=====

Please note that the forward slash character `/` typically separating IPv4 and
IPv6 addresses from the mask length is transformed into `%2f` when used in a
URL.

=== Karaf commands

In this section we will discuss two types of Karaf commands: built-in, and
LISP specific. Some built-in commands are quite useful, and are needed for the
tutorial, so they will be discussed here. A reference of all LISP specific
commands, added by the LISP Flow Mapping project is also included. They are
useful mostly for debugging.

==== Useful built-in commands

+help+::
    Lists all available command, with a short description of each.

+help <command_name>+::
    Show detailed help about a specific command.

+feature:list [-i]+::
    Show all locally available features in the Karaf container. The `-i`
    option lists only features that are currently installed. It is possible to
    use `| grep` to filter the output (for all commands, not just this one).

+feature:install <feature_name>+::
    Install feature `feature_name`.

+log:set <level> <class>+::
    Set the log level for `class` to `level`. The default log level for all
    classes is INFO. For debugging, or learning about LISP internals it is
    useful to run `log:set TRACE org.opendaylight.lispflowmapping` right after
    Karaf starts up.

+log:display+::
    Outputs the log file to the console, and returns control to the user.

+log:tail+::
    Continuously shows log output, requires `Ctrl+C` to return to the console.

==== LISP specific commands

The available lisp commands can always be obtained by `help lisp`. Currently
they are:

+lisp:addkey+::
    Add the default password `password` for the IPv4 EID prefix 0.0.0.0/0 (all
    addresses). This is useful when experimenting with southbound devices,
    and using the REST interface would be combersome for whatever reason.

+lisp:mappings+::
    Show the list of all mappings stored in the internal non-persistent data
    store (the DAO), listing the full data structure. The output is not human
    friendly, but can be used for debugging.

=== Tutorials

This section provides a tutorial demonstrating various features in this service.

==== Creating a LISP overlay

This section provides instructions to set up a LISP network of three nodes (one
"client" node and two "server" nodes) using LISPmob as data plane LISP nodes
and the LISP Flow Mapping project from OpenDaylight as the LISP programmable
mapping system for the LISP network.

===== Overview

The steps shown below will demonstrate setting up a LISP network between a
client and two servers, then performing a failover between the two "server"
nodes.

===== Prerequisites

* *OpenDaylight Lithium*
* *The Postman Chrome App*: the most convenient way to follow along this
  tutorial is to use the
  https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en[Postman
  Chrome App] to edit and send the requests. The project git repository hosts
  a collection of the requests that are used in this tutorial in the
  +resources/tutorial/Lithium_Tutorial.json.postman_collection+ file. You can
  import this file to Postman by clicking 'Import' at the top, choosing
  'Download from link' and then entering the following URL:
  +https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/Lithium_Tutorial.json.postman_collection;hb=refs/heads/stable/lithium+.
  Alternatively, you can save the file on your machine, or if you have the
  repository checked out, you can import from there. You will need to create a
  new Postman Environment and define some variables within: +controllerHost+
  set to the hostname or IP address of the machine running the ODL instance,
  and +restconfPort+ to 8181, if you didn't modify the default controller
  settings.
* *LISPmob version 0.5.x*  At the time of this writing this version has not
  been reelased yet, but it is available in the 'experimental' branch in the
  project's https://github.com/LISPmob/lispmob/tree/experimental[Git
  repository].  The README.md lists the dependencies needed to build it from
  source.
* *A virtualization platform*

===== Target Environment

The three LISP data plane nodes and the LISP mapping system are assumed to be
running in Linux virtual machines, which have the +eth0+ interface in NAT mode
to allow outside internet access and +eth1+ connected to a host-only network,
with the following IP addresses (please adjust configuration files, JSON
examples, etc. accordingly if you're using another addressing scheme):

.Nodes in the tutorial
[align="right",options="header"]
|===
| Node            |  Node Type     | IP Address
| *controller*    |  OpenDaylight  | 192.168.16.11
| *client*        |  LISPmob       | 192.168.16.30
| *server1*       |  LISPmob       | 192.168.16.31
| *server2*       |  LISPmob       | 192.168.16.32
| *service-node*  |  LISPmob       | 192.168.16.33
|===

NOTE: While the tutorial uses LISPmob as the data plane, it could be any
      LISP-enabled hardware or software router (commercial/open source).

===== Instructions

The below steps use the command line tool cURL to talk to the LISP Flow
Mapping RPC REST API. This is so that you can see the actual request URLs and
body content on the page.

 . Install and run OpenDaylight Lithium release on the controller VM. Please
   follow the general OpenDaylight Lithium Installation Guide for this step.
   Once the OpenDaylight controller is running install the
   'odl-openflowplugin-all' feature from the Karaf CLI:

 feature:install odl-lispflowmapping-all
+
It takes quite a while to load and initialize all features and their
dependencies. It's worth running the command +log:tail+ in the Karaf console
to see when the log output is winding down, and continue with the tutorial
after that.

 . Install LISPmob on the *client*, *server1*, *server2*, and *service-node*
   VMs following the installation instructions
   https://github.com/LISPmob/lispmob#software-prerequisites[from the LISPmob
   README file].

 . Configure the LISPmob installations from the previous step. Starting from
   the +lispd.conf.example+ file in the distribution, set the EID in each
   +lispd.conf+ file from the IP address space selected for your virtual/LISP
   network. In this tutorial the EID of the *client* is set to 1.1.1.1/32, and
   that of *server1* and *server2* to 2.2.2.2/32.

 . Set the RLOC interface to +eth1+ in each +lispd.conf+ file. LISP will
   determine the RLOC (IP address of the corresponding VM) based on this
   interface.

 . Set the Map-Resolver address to the IP address of the *controller*, and on
   the *client* the Map-Server too. On *server1* and *server2* set the
   Map-Server to something else, so that it doesn't interfere with the
   mappings on the controller, since we're going to program them manually.

 . Modify the "key" parameter in each +lispd.conf+ file to a key/password of
   your choice ('password' in this tutorial).
+
NOTE: The +resources/tutorial+ directory in the 'stable/lithium' branch of the
      project git repository has the files used in the tutorial
      https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=tree;f=resources/tutorial;hb=refs/heads/stable/lithium[checked
      in], so you can just copy the files to +/root/lispd.conf+ on the
      respective VMs. You will also find the JSON files referenced below in
      the same directory.
+
 . Define a key and EID prefix association in OpenDaylight using the RPC REST
   API for the *client* EID (1.1.1.1/32) to allow registration from the
   southbound. Since the mappings for the server EID will be configured from
   the REST API, no such association is necessary. Run the below command on
   the *controller* (or any machine that can reach *controller*, by replacing
   'localhost' with the IP address of *controller*).

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/lfm-mapping-database:add-key \
     --data @add-key.json

+
where the content of the 'add-key.json' file is the following:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "input": {
        "LispAddressContainer": {
            "Ipv4Address": {
                "afi": 1,
                "Ipv4Address": "1.1.1.1"
            }
        },
        "mask-length": 32,
        "key-type": 1,
        "authkey": "password"
   }
}
----

 . Verify that the key is added properly by requesting the following URL:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/lfm-mapping-database:get-key \
     --data @get1.json

+
where the content of the 'get1.json' file can be derived from the
'add-key.json' file by removing the 'key-type' and 'authkey' fields.  The
output the above invocation should look like this:

 {"output":{"authkey":"password"}}

 . Run the +lispd+ LISPmob daemon on all VMs:

 lispd -f /root/lispd.conf

 . The *client* LISPmob node should now register its EID-to-RLOC mapping in
   OpenDaylight. To verify you can lookup the corresponding EIDs via the REST
   API

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/lfm-mapping-database:get-mapping \
     --data @get1.json

+
An alternative way for retrieving mappings from ODL using the southbound
interface is using the https://github.com/davidmeyer/lig[+lig+] open source
tool.

 . Register the EID-to-RLOC mapping of the server EID 2.2.2.2/32 to the
   controller, pointing to *server1* and *server2* with a higher priority for
   *server1*

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/lfm-mapping-database:add-mapping \
     --data @mapping.json
+
where the 'mapping.json' file looks like this:
+
[source,json]

                    }
                }
            },

                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
+
Here the priority of the second RLOC (192.168.16.32 - *server2*) is 2, a higher
numeric value than the priority of 192.168.16.31, which is 1. This policy is
saying that *server1* is preferred to *server2* for reaching EID 2.2.2.2/32.
Note that lower priority value has higher preference in LISP.

 . Verify the correct registration of the 2.2.2.2/32 EID:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/lfm-mapping-database:get-mapping \
     --data @get2.json

+
where 'get2.json' can be derived from 'get1.json' by changing the content of
the 'Ipv4Address' field from '1.1.1.1' to '2.2.2.2'.

 . Now the LISP network is up. To verify, log into the *client* VM and ping the server EID:

 ping 2.2.2.2

 . Let's test fail-over now. Suppose you had a service on *server1* which
   became unavailable, but *server1* itself is still reachable. LISP will not
   automatically fail over, even if the mapping for 2.2.2.2/32 has two
   locators, since both locators are still reachable and uses the one with the
   higher priority (lowest priority value). To force a failover, we need to
   set the priority of *server2* to a lower value. Using the file mapping.json
   above, swap the priority values between the two locators (lines 15 and 31
   in 'mapping.json') and repeat the request from step 11.  You can also
   repeat step 12 to see if the mapping is correctly registered.  If you leave
   the ping on, and monitor the traffic using wireshark, you can see that the
   ping traffic to 2.2.2.2 will be diverted from the *server1* RLOC to the
   *server2* RLOC.
+
With the default OpenDaylight configuration the failover should be near
instantaneous (we observed 3 lost pings in the worst case), because of the
LISP http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-6.6.2[Solicit-Map-Request
(SMR) mechanism] that can ask a LISP data plane element to update its mapping
for a certain EID (enabled by default). It is controlled by the +lisp.smr+
variable in +etc/custom.porperties+. When enabled, any mapping change from the
RPC interface will trigger an SMR packet to all data plane elements that have
requested the mapping in the last 15 minutes. If disabled, ITRs keep their
mappings until the TTL specified in the Map-Reply expires.

 . To add a service chain into the path from the client to the server, we can
   use an Explicit Locator Path, specifying the *service-node* as the first
   hop and *server1* (or *server2*) as the second hop. The following will
   achieve that:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/lfm-mapping-database:add-mapping \
     --data @elp.json
+
where the 'elp.json' file is as follows:

After the mapping for 2.2.2.2/32 is updated with the above, the ICMP traffic
from *client* to *server1* will flow through the *service-node*. You can
confirm this in the LISPmob logs, or by sniffing the traffic on either the
*service-node* or *server1*. Note that service chains are unidirectional, so
unless another ELP mapping is added for the return traffic, packets will go
from *server1* to *client* directly.

 . Suppose the *service-node* is actually a firewall, and traffic is diverted
   there to support access control lists (ACLs). In this tutorial that can be
   emulated by using +iptables+ firewall rules in the *service-node* VM. To
   deny traffic on the service chain defined above, the following rule can be
   added:

 iptables -A OUTPUT --dst 192.168.16.31 -j DROP

+
The ping from the *client* should now have stopped.
+
In this case the ACL is done on the destination RLOC. There is an effort underway in the LISPmob
community to allow filtering on EIDs, which is the more logical place to apply
ACLs.

 . To delete the rule and restore connectivity on the service chain, delete
   the ACL by issuing the following command:

 iptables -D OUTPUT --dst 192.168.16.31 -j DROP

+
which should restore connectivity.
