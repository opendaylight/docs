== LISP Flow Mapping User Guide

=== Overview

The lispflowmapping-all feature enables the LISP Mapping Service in OpenDaylight.

==== Locator/ID Separation Protocol

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830[Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP)] is a
technology that provides a flexible map-and-encap framework that can be used
for overlay network applications such as data center network virtualization and
Network Function Virtualization (NFV).

LISP provides the following name spaces:

* http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#page-6[Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs)]
* http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-3[Routing Locators (RLOCs)]

In a virtualization environment EIDs can be viewed as virtual address space and
RLOCs can be viewed as physical network address space.

The LISP framework decouples network control plane from the forwarding plane by
providing:

* A data plane that specifies how the virtualized network addresses are
  encapsulated in addresses from the underlying physical network.
* A control plane that stores the mapping of the virtual-to-physical address
  spaces and the associated forwarding policies and serves this information to
  the data plane on demand.

Network programmability is achieved by programming forwarding policies such as
transparent mobility, service chaining, and traffic engineering in the mapping
system; where the data plane elements can fetch these policies on demand as new
flows arrive. This chapter describes the LISP Flow Mapping project in
OpenDaylight and how it can be used to enable advanced SDN and NFV use cases.

LISP data plane Tunnel Routers are available at
http://LISPmob.org/[LISPmob.org] in the open source community on the following
platforms:

* Linux
* Android
* OpenWRT

For more details and support for LISP data plane software please visit
http://LISPmob.org/[the LISPmob web site].

==== LISP Flow Mapping Service

The LISP Flow Mapping service provides LISP Mapping System services. This
includes LISP  Map-Server and LISP Map-Resolver services to store and serve
mapping data to data plane nodes as well as to OpenDaylight applications.
Mapping data can include mapping of virtual addresses to physical network
address where the virtual nodes are reachable or hosted at. Mapping data can
also include a variety of routing policies including traffic engineering and
load balancing. To leverage this service, OpenDaylight applications and
services can use the northbound REST API to define the mappings and policies in
the LISP Mapping Service. Data plane devices capable of LISP control protocol
can leverage this service through a southbound LISP plugin. LISP-enabled
devices must be configured to use this OpenDaylight service as their Map Server
and/or Map Resolver.

The southbound LISP plugin supports the LISP control protocol (Map-Register,
Map-Request, Map-Reply messages), and can also be used at register mappings in
the OpenDaylight mapping service.

=== LISP Flow Mapping Architecture

The following figure shows the various LISP Flow Mapping modules.

.LISP Mapping Service Internal Architecture

image::lispflow-technical-arch-overview-helium.jpg["LISP Mapping Service Internal Architecture", width=460]

A brief description of each module is as follows:

* *DAO:* This layer separates the LISP logic from the database, so that we can
separate the map server and map resolver from the specific implementation of
the DHT (Distributed Hash Table). Currently we have an implementation of this
layer with the controller cluster service as a DHT, but it can be switched to
any other DHT and you only need to implement the ILISPDAO interface.

* *Map Server:* This module processes the adding or registration of keys and
  mappings. For a detailed specification of LISP Map Server, see
  http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* *Map Resolver:* This module receives and processes the mapping lookup queries
  and provides the mappings to requester. For a detailed specification of LISP
  Map Server, see http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc6830[LISP].
* *Northbound API:* This is part of the OpenDaylight northbound API. This
  module enables defining key-EID associations as well as adding mapping
  information through the Map Server. Key-EID associations can also be queried
  via this API. The Northbound API also provides capability of querying the
  mapping information for an EID prefix.
* *Neutron:* This module implements the OpenDaylight Neutron Service APIs. It
  provides integration between the LISP service and the OpenDaylight Neutron
  service.
* *NETCONF:* This module enables the LISP service to communicate to
  NETCONF-enabled devices through OpenDaylight's NETCONF plugin.
* *Java API:* The API module exposes the Map Server and Map Resolver
  capabilities via Java API.
* *LISP Southbound Plugin:* This plugin enables data plane devices that support
  LISP control plane protocol (see LISP) to register and query mappings to the
  LISP Flow Mapping via the LISP control plane protocol.


=== Configuring LISP Flow Mapping

In order to use the LISP mapping service for registering EID to RLOC mappings
from NB or SB, keys have to be defined for the EID prefixes first. Once a key
is defined for an EID prefix, it can be used to add mappings for that EID
prefix multiple times. If the service is going to be used to process Map
Register messages from the southbound LISP plugin, the same key must be used by
the data plane device to create the authentication data in the Map-Register
messages for the associated EID prefix.

The +etc/custom.properties+ file in the Karaf distribution allows configuration
of several OpenDaylight parameters.  The LISP service has two properties that
can be adjusted: +lisp.mappingOverwrite+ and +lisp.smr+.

*lisp.mappingOverwrite* (default: 'true')::
    Configures handling of mapping updates.  When set to 'true' (default) a
    mapping update (either through the southbound plugin via a Map-Register
    message or through a northbound API PUT REST call) the existing RLOC set
    associated to an EID prefix is overwritten.  When set to 'false', the RLOCs
    of the update are merged to the existing set.

*lisp.smr* (default: 'false')::
    Enables/disables the
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-6.6.2[Solicit-Map-Request (SMR)]
    functionality.  SMR is a method to notify changes in an EID-to-RLOC mapping
    to "subscribers".  The LISP service considers all Map-Request's source RLOC
    as a subscriber to the requested EID prefix, and will send an SMR control
    message to that RLOC if the mapping changes.

=== Tutorials

This section provides a tutorial demonstrating various features in this service.

==== Creating a LISP overlay

This section provides instructions to set up a LISP network of three nodes (one
"client" node and two "server" nodes) using LISPmob and Open vSwitch (OVS) as
data plane LISP nodes and the LISP Flow Mapping project from OpenDaylight as
the LISP programmable mapping system for the LISP network.

===== Overview

The steps shown below will demonstrate setting up a LISP network between a
client and two servers. Then performing a failover between the two "server"
nodes.

===== Prerequisites

NOTE: It is more convenient to use the Postman Chrome browser plugin to edit
and send the requests. The project git repository hosts a collection of the
requests that are used in this tutorial in the
+resources/tutorial/ODL_Summit_LISP_Demo.json+ file. You can import this file
to Postman by following 'Collections->Import a collection->Import from URL' and
then entering the following link:
+https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/ODL_Summit_LISP_Demo.json;hb=refs/heads/develop+.
Alternatively, you can save the file on your machine, or if you have the
repository checked out, you can import from there. You will need to define some
variables to point to your OpenDaylight controller instance.

NOTE: It is assumed that commands are executed as the 'root' user.

NOTE: To set up a basic LISP network overlay (no fail-over) without dealing
      with OVS, you can skip steps 7 and 8 and just use LISPmob as your
      dataplane. If you do want to test fail-over, but not using OVS, skip
      steps 7 and 8, but set up LISPmob on *server2* as well, with identical
      configuration.

===== Target Environment

The three LISP data plane nodes and the LISP mapping system are assumed to be
running in Linux virtual machines using the following IPv4 addresses on their
eth0 interfaces (please adjust configuration files, JSON examples, etc.
accordingly if you're using another addressing scheme):

.Nodes in the tutorial
[align="right",options="header"]
|===
| Node          |  Node Type     | IP Address
| *controller*  |  OpenDaylight  | 10.33.12.32
| *client*      |  LISPmob       | 10.33.12.35
| *server1*     |  LISPmob       | 10.33.12.37
| *server2*     |  Open vSwitch  | 10.33.12.44
|===

Note: While the tutorial uses LISPmob and OVS as the data plane, they could be
any LISP-enabled HW or SW router (commercial/open source).

===== Instructions

The below steps are using the command line tool cURL to talk to the LISP Flow
Mapping northbound REST API. This is so that you can see the actual request
URLs and body content on the page.

. Install and run OpenDaylight Helium release on the controller VM. Please
  follow the general OpenDaylight Helium Installation Guide for this step. Once
  the OpenDaylight controller is running install the 'odl-openflowplugin-all',
  'odl-adsal-compatibility-all', 'odl-ovsdb-all', and 'odl-lispflowmapping-all'
  features from the CLI:

 feature:install odl-openflowplugin-all odl-adsal-compatibility-all odl-ovsdb-all odl-lispflowmapping-all
+
NOTE: If you're not planning on using OVS you can skip the first three and
install 'odl-lispflowmapping-all' only.
+
It takes quite a while to load and initialize all features and their
dependencies. It's worth running the command +log:tail+ in the Karaf console to
see when is the log output winding down, and continue after that.

. Install LISPmob on the *client* and *server1* VMs following the installation
instructions https://github.com/LISPmob/lispmob#software-prerequisites[from the LISPmob README file].

. Configure the LISPmob installations from the previous step. Starting from the
+lispd.conf.example+ file in the distribution, set the EID in each +lispd.conf+
file from the IP address space selected for your virtual/LISP network. In this
tutorial the EID of the *client* is set to 1.1.1.1/32, and that of *server1* to
2.2.2.2/32. Set the RLOC interface in each +lispd.conf+. LISP will determine
the RLOC (IP address of the corresponding VM) based on this interface. Set the
Map-Resolver address to the IP address of the *controller*, and on the *client*
the Map-Server too. On *server1* set the Map-Server to something else, so that
it doesn't interfere with the mappings on the controller, since we're going to
program them manually. Modify the "key" parameter in each +lispd.conf+ file to
a key/password of your choice, 'asdf' in this tutorial. The
+resources/tutorial+ directory in the 'develop' branch of the project git
repository has the files used in the tutorial checked in:
https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/lispd.conf.client;hb=refs/heads/develop[lispd.conf.client]
and https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=lispflowmapping.git;a=blob_plain;f=resources/tutorial/lispd.conf.server1;hb=refs/heads/develop[lispd.conf.server1].
Copy the files to +/root/lispd.conf+ on the respective VMs.

. Define a key and EID prefix association in OpenDaylight using the northbound
API for both EIDs (1.1.1.1/32 and 2.2.2.2/32).  Run the below commands on the
*controller* (or any machine that can reach *controller*, by replacing
'localhost' with the IP address of *controller*).

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key \
     --data @key1.json
 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key \
     --data @key2.json

+
where the content of the 'key1.json' and 'key2.json' files is the following
(with different "ipAddress"):
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "key" : "asdf",
  "maskLength" : 32,
  "address" :
  {
    "ipAddress" : "1.1.1.1",
    "afi" : 1
  }
}
----

. Verify that the key is added properly by requesting the following URL:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key/0/1/1.1.1.1/32
 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/key/0/1/2.2.2.2/32

. Run the lispd LISPmob daemon on the *client* and *server1* VMs:

 lispd -f /root/lispd.conf

. Prepare the OVS environment on *server2*:

 .. Start the ovsdb-server and ovs-vswitchd daemons (or check that your
    distribution's init scripts already started them)
 .. Start listening for OVSDB manager connections on the standard 6640 TCP port:

 ovs-vsctl set-manager "ptcp:6640"
 ovs-vsctl show

+
 .. Create a TAP port for communications with the guest VM.  We'll have another
    VM inside the *server2* VM, that will be set up with the 2.2.2.2/24 EID. It
    also needs a ficticious gateway, and a static ARP entry for that gateway,
    with any MAC address.

 tunctl -t tap0
 ifconfig tap0 up

+
 .. Start the guest VM:

 modprobe kvm
 kvm -daemonize -vnc :0 -m 128 -net nic,macaddr=00:00:0C:15:C0:A1 \
     -net tap,ifname=tap0,script=no,downscript=no \
     -drive file=ubuntu.12-04.x86-64.20120425.static_ip_2.2.2.2.qcow2

+
. Set up the OVS environment on *server2* using the OpenDaylight northbound API
 .. Connect to the OVSDB management port from OpenDaylight:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/connectionmanager/node/server2/address/10.33.12.44/port/6640

+
You can check if this and the next requests have the desired effect on OVS by
running the following on *server2*

 ovs-vsctl show

+
It should now show the "Manager" connection as connected

 .. Create the bridge +br0+:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/networkconfig/bridgedomain/bridge/OVS/server2/br0 -d "{}"

 .. Add +tap0+ to +br0+:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/networkconfig/bridgedomain/port/OVS/server2/br0/tap0 -d "{}"

+
 .. Add the +lisp0+ LISP tunneling virtual port to +br0+:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/networkconfig/bridgedomain/port/OVS/server2/br0/lisp0 -d @lisp0.json
+
where 'lisp0.json' has the following content:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "tunnel",
  "tunnel_type": "lisp",
  "dest_ip": "10.33.12.35"
}
----
The *dest_ip* parameter sets the tunnel destination to the *client* VM. This
has to be done manually (from the controller), since OVS doesn't have a LISP
control plane to fetch mappings.

 .. We will now need to set up flows on +br0+ to to steer traffic received on
    the LISP virtual port in OVS to the VM connected to +tap0+ and vice-versa.
    For that we will need the node id of the bridge, which is based on its MAC
    address, which is generated at creation time. So we look at the list of
    connections on the controller:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/connectionmanager/nodes
+
The response should look similar to this:
+
[literal]
{"id":"00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44","type":"OF"}]},{"id":"10.33.12.35","type":"LISP"},{"id":"server2","type":"OVS"}]}
+
There are three types of nodes connected to OpenDaylight: one "OF" node (the
OpenFlow connection to +br0+ on *server2*), one "LISP" node (the *client* VM
sending LISP Map-Register control messages to the controller which is acting as
a LISP Map-Server), and one "OVS" node (this is the OVSDB connection to
*server2*). We will need the id of the "OF" node in order to set up flows.

 .. The first flow will decapsulate traffic received from the client VM on
    *server2* and send it to the guest VM through the +tap0+ port.

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/flowprogrammer/default/node/OF/00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44/staticFlow/Decap -d @flow_decap.json
+
Make sure that the bridge id after the OF path component of the URL is the id
from the previous step. It should also be the same on line 6 in
'flow_decap.json' file (see below), which should have the MAC address of the
KVM instance started on *server2* on line 11 (+SET_DL_DST+):
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "installInHw": "true",
  "name": "Decap",
  "node": {
    "type": "OF",
    "id": "00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44"
  },
  "priority": "10",
  "dlDst": "02:00:00:00:00:00",
  "actions": [
    "SET_DL_DST=00:00:0c:15:c0:a1",
    "OUTPUT=1"
  ]
}
----

 .. The second flow will encapsulate traffic received from the guest VM on
    *server2* through the +tap0+ port.

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/flowprogrammer/default/node/OF/00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44/staticFlow/Encap -d @flow_encap.json
+
The 'flow_encap.json' file should look like this:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "installInHw": "true",
  "name": "Decap",
  "node": {
    "type": "OF",
    "id": "00:00:62:71:36:30:7b:44"
  },
  "priority": "5",
  "ingressPort": "1",
  "etherType": "0x0800",
  "vlanId": "0",
  "nwDst": "1.1.1.1/32",
  "actions": [
    "OUTPUT=2"
  ]
}
----

 .. Check if the flows have been created correctly. First, in OpenDaylight

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/controller/nb/v2/flowprogrammer/default
+
And most importantly, on *server2*

 ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 -O OpenFlow13

. The *client* LISPmob node should now register its EID-to-RLOC mapping in
  OpenDaylight. To verify you can lookup the corresponding EIDs via the northbound API

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/mapping/0/1/1.1.1.1/32

 . Register the EID-to-RLOC mapping of the server EID 2.2.2.2/32 to the
   controller, pointing to *server1* and *server2* with a higher priority for
   *server1*

 curl -u "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X PUT \
     http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/mapping \
     -d @mapping.json
+
where the 'mapping.json' file looks like this
+
[source,json]
----
{
"key" : "asdf",
"mapregister" :
  {
  "proxyMapReply" : true,
  "eidToLocatorRecords" :
    [
      {
      "authoritative" : true,
      "prefixGeneric" :
        {
        "ipAddress" : "2.2.2.2",
        "afi" : 1
        },
      "mapVersion" : 0,
      "maskLength" : 32,
      "action" : "NoAction",
      "locators" :
        [
          {
          "multicastPriority" : 1,
          "locatorGeneric" :
            {
            "ipAddress" : "10.33.12.37",
            "afi" : 1
            },
          "routed" : true,
          "multicastWeight" : 0,
          "rlocProbed" : false,
          "localLocator" : false,
          "priority" : 126,
          "weight" : 1
          } ,
          {
          "multicastPriority" : 1,
          "locatorGeneric" :
            {
            "ipAddress" : "10.33.12.44",
            "afi" : 1
            },
          "routed" : true,
          "multicastWeight" : 0,
          "rlocProbed" : false,
          "localLocator" : false,
          "priority" : 127,
          "weight" : 1
          }
        ],
      "recordTtl" : 5
      }
    ],
  "keyId" : 0
  }
}
----
+
Here the priority of the second RLOC (10.33.12.44 - *server2*) is 127, a higher
numeric value than the priority of 10.33.12.37, which is 126. This policy is
saying that *server1* is preferred to *server2* for reaching EID 2.2.2.2/32.
Note that lower priority has higher preference in LISP.

 . Verify the correct registration of the 2.2.2.2/32 EID:

 curl -u "admin":"admin" http://localhost:8080/lispflowmapping/nb/v2/default/mapping/0/1/2.2.2.2/32

 . Now the LISP network is up. To verify, log into the *client* VM and ping the server EID:

 ping 2.2.2.2

 . Let's test fail-over now. Suppose you had a service on *server1* which
became unavailable, but *server1* itself is still reachable. LISP will not
automatically fail over, even if the mapping for 2.2.2.2/32 has two locators,
since both locators are still reachable and uses the one with the higher
priority (lowest priority value). To force a failover, we need to set the
priority of *server2* to a lower value. Using the file mapping.json above, swap
the priority values between the two locators and repeat the request from step
10. You can also repeat step 11 to see if the mapping is correctly registered.
Not that the previous locators are still present, so you should see a list of
four locators. If you leave the ping on, and monitor the traffic using
wireshark you can see that the ping traffic will be diverted from *server1* to
*server2*.
+
With the default OpenDaylight configuration this may take some time, because
the mapping stays in the *client* map-cache until the TTL expires. LISP has a
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6830#section-6.6.2[Solicit-Map-Request (SMR) mechanism]
that can ask a LISP data plane element to update its mapping for a certain EID.
This is disabled by default, and is controlled by the +lisp.smr+ variable in
+etc/custom.porperties+. When enabled, any mapping change from the northbound
will trigger an SMR packet to all data plane elements that have requested the
mapping in a certain time window.

If you used the Postman collection, you will notice an "ELP" mapping. This is
for supporting service chaining, but it requires a Re-encapsulating Tunnel
Router (RTR). Support for RTR functionality in LISPmob is in progress, and we
will update the tutorial to demonstrate service chaining when it becomes
available.
