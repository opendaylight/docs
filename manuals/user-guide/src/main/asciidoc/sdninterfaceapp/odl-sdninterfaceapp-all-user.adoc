== ODL-SDNi User Guide

=== Introduction
This user guide will help to setup the ODL-SDNi application for lithium release and contains the examples configuration using ODL-BGPCEP.

=== Components
SDNiAggregator(controller), SDNi REST API(controller) and SDNiWrapper(bgpcep) are the three components in ODL-SDNi App  

* SDNiAggregator: Connects with switch, topology, hosttracker managers of controller to get the topology and other related data.
* SDNi REST API: It is a part of controller northbound, which gives the required information by quering SDNiAggregator
* SDNiWrapper: This component uses the SDNi REST API and gathers the information required to be shared among controllers.

=== Trouble shooting
To work with multiple controllers, change some of the configuration in config.ini file. For example change the listening port of one controller to 6653 and other controller to 6663 in /root/controller/opendaylight/distribution/opendaylight/target/distribution.opendaylight-osgipackage/opendaylight/configuration/config.ini (i.e of.listenPort=6653).

.Open Flow related system parameters
TCP port on which the controller is listening (default 6633) of.listenPort=6653
