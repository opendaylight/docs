== CAPWAP User Guide
This document describes how to use the Control And Provisioning of Wireless 
Access Points (CAPWAP) feature in OpenDaylight.  This document contains 
configuration, administration, and management sections for the feature.

=== Overview
CAPWAP feature fills the gap Opendaylight Controller has with respect to managing 
CAPWAP compliant wireless termination point (WTP) network devices present 
in enterprise networks. Intelligent applications (e.g. centralized firmware 
management, radio planning) can be developed by tapping into the 
WTP network device's operational states via REST APIs.

=== CAPWAP Architecture
The CAPWAP feature is implemented as an MD-SAL based provider module, which 
helps discover WTP devices and update their states in MD-SAL operational datastore.

=== Scope of CAPWAP Project
In the Lithium release, CAPWAP project aims to only detect the WTPs and store their 
basic attributes in the operational data store, which is accessible via REST 
and JAVA APIs.

=== Installing CAPWAP
To install CAPWAP, download OpenDaylight and use the Karaf console to install 
the following feature:

odl-capwap-ac-rest

=== Configuring CAPWAP

As of Lithium, there are no configuration requirements.

=== Administering or Managing CAPWAP

After installing the odl-capwap-ac-rest feature from the Karaf console, users 
can administer and manage CAPWAP from the APIDOCS explorer.

Go to http://${IPADDRESS}:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html, sign in, and expand 
the capwap-impl panel.  From there, users can execute various API calls.

=== Tutorials

==== Viewing Discovered WTPs

===== Overview
This tutorial can be used as a walk through to understand the steps for 
starting the CAPWAP feature, detecting CAPWAP WTPs, accessing the 
operational states of WTPs.

===== Prerequisites
It is assumed that user has access to at least one hardware/software based CAPWAP 
compliant WTP. These devices should be configured with OpenDaylight controller 
IP address as a CAPWAP Access Controller (AC) address. It is also assumed that 
WTPs and OpenDaylight controller share the same ethernet broadcast domain.

===== Instructions
. Run the OpenDaylight distribution and install odl-capwap-ac-rest from the Karaf console.
. Go to http://${IPADDRESS}:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html 
. Expand capwap-impl
. Click /operational/capwap-impl:capwap-ac-root/
. Click "Try it out"
. The above step should display list of WTPs discovered using ODL CAPWAP feature.
