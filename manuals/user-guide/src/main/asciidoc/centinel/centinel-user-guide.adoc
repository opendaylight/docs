== Centinel User Guide
The Centinel project aims at providing a distributed, reliable framework for
efficiently collecting, aggregating and sinking streaming data across Persistence
DB and stream analyzers (example: Graylog, Elastic search, Spark, Hive etc.).
This document contains configuration, administration, management, using
sections for the feature.

=== Overview
In the Beryllium Release of Centinel, This framework enables SDN applications/services to receive events from multiple streaming sources (example: Syslog, Thrift, Avro, AMQP, Log4j, HTTP/REST etc) and execute actions like network configuration/batch processing/real-time analytics. Provides Log Service to assist operators running SDN ecosystem by installing the feature odl-centinel-all. 

With the configurations development of "Log Service" and plug-in for log analyzer (i.e. Graylog) will take place. Log service will do processing of real time events coming from log analyzer. Additionally, stream collector (flume and sqoop based) that will collect logs from Opendaylight and sink it to persistence service (integrated with TSDR). Also includes Restconf interface to inject events to north bound applications for real-time analytic/network configuration. Centinel User Interface (web interface) will be available to operators to enable rules/alerts/dashboard etc. 


=== Centinel core features
Core features of Centinel framework are:

* Stream collector - Collecting, aggregating and sinking streaming data
* Log Service - Listen log stream events coming from log analyzer
* Log Service - Enables user to configure rules (example: alerts, diagnostic, health, dashboard etc.)
* Log Service - Performs event processing/analytics
* User Interface - Enable set-rule, search, visualize, alert, diagnostic, dashboard etc.
* Adaptor - Log analyzer plug-in to Graylog and a generic data-model to extend to other stream analyzers (Logstash etc.)
* REST Services - Northbound APIs for Log Service and Steam collector framework
* Leverages - TSDR persistence service, data query, purging and elastic search

=== Administering or Managing Centinel with default configuration


* Prerequisites

. Check whether Graylog is up and running and plugins deployed as mentioned in installation steps.

. Check whether Hbase is up and respective tables and column families as mentioned in installation guide are created.

. Check if apache flume is up and running.

. Check if apache drill is up and running.



* Running Centinel

Following Step should be followed to bring up the controller:

. Download the Centinel OpenDaylight distribution release from below link :

. Run Karaf of the distribution from bin folder

  ./karaf

. Install the centinel features using below command:

  feature:install odl-centinel-all

. Give some time for the centinel to come up.

* User Actions

. Log In:

  User logs into the Centinel with required credentials using following URL:Localhost:8181/index.html

. Create Rule:

.. Select Centinel sub-tree present in left side and go to Rule tab.

.. Create Rule with title and description.

.. Configure flow rule on the stream to filter the logs accordingly for eg. bundle_name=org.opendaylight.openflow-plugin

. Set Alarm Condition:

  Configure alarm condition e.g. message-count-rule such that if 10 messages comes on a stream ( i.e openflow-plugin) in
  last 1 minute with an alert is generated.

. Subscription

  User can subscribe to the rule and alarm condition by entering the http details or email-id in subscription textfield by clicking on
the subscribe button.

. Create Dashboard:

  Configure dashboard for stream and alert widgets.

. Alarm and Stream count will be updated in corresponding widget in Dashboard.

. Event Tab

  Intercepted Logs, Alarms and Raw Logs in Event Tab will be displayed by selecting the appropriate radio button.

  User can also filter the searched data using sql query in the search box.
