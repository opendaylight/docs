=== Key Features

The following table describes the key features provided by the OpenDaylight controller.

[cols="2",option="headers"]
|==============================================
| *Feature* | *Description*
|  Maven support | Used to simplify build automation.
| OSGi framework | Serves as the controller&#8217;s back-end, allowing it to dynamically load bundles, package JAR files, and bind bundles together when exchanging information.
| Java interface support | Used by specific bundles to implement call-back functions for events and indicate the awareness of specific states.
| Service Abstraction Layer (SAL) | Allows the controller to support multiple protocols (such as BGP-LS and OpenFlow) on the southbound interface. Also provides consistent services for modules and applications (which is where the business logic is embedded).
| Switch Manager | Once a network element has been discovered, its details (such as device type, software version, etc.) are stored by the Switch Manager.
| High Availability (HA) | The controller supports cluster-based HA, allowing you to connect multiple controllers and configure them to act as one in order	 to ensure the controller&#8217;s continuous operation.
|==============================================

=== Target Environment

NOTE: If you are using Oracle, JDK version 1.7.0_45 or later is required.

==== For Execution

The OpenDaylight controller source files are completely portable and only require a Java 7-compliant JVM to run.

==== For Development

Although the OpenDaylight controller is developed as a normal Java project, it makes heavy use of the Xtend language. While development is possible with bare tools, we recommend you use Eclipse with the Xtend plugin.
