== Uni Manager User Guide

=== Overview
The User Network Interface (UNI) Manager plugin enables physical and virtual network elements to be remotely configured with Service Level Agreement (SLA) parameters and layer-2 connectivity to enable delivery of business services between two network elements. Specifically, the UNI Manager plugin enables configuration of UNI functionality in network elements, and connectivity between the network elements for Ethernet Private Line (EPL) services as defined by Metro Ethernet Forum (MEF), as the initial use case. Other use cases such as Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) service and Ethernet LAN (ELAN) service provide opportunity for future extension.
