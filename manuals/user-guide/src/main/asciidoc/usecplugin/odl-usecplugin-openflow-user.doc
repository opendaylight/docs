== Usecplugin-OpenFlow User Guide
The Usecplugin-OpenFlow User Guide contains information about configuration, administration,
management, using and troubleshooting the feature.

=== Overview
Usecplugin-OpenFlow collects information about potential OpenFlow Packet_In attacks to Opendaylight.
A threshold (water mark) can be set for the Packet_In rate which when breached will trigger Packet_In message
information collection. 

=== Usecplugin Architecture
Usecplugin listens on OpenFlow southbound interface for Packet_In messages. When the rate of Packet_In
breaches the water mark the application parses the message for header information which is subsequently
stored in Yang Data Store and a log file. Usecplugin has PacketHandler class that implements the PacketProcessing
interface to override the OnPacketReceived notification by which the application is notified of Packet_In messages.

=== Configuring Usecplugin-OpenFlow

Use feature installation feature in ODL as feature:install odl-usecplugin-openflow

User can set the low water mark, high water mark for Packet_In rates as well as number of samples for checking the time interval to calculate Packet_In rate. 

URI :: http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/usecplugin(2015-01-05)

High Water Mark Configuration :: {"usecplugin:sample-data-hwm": { "samples":"3000","highWaterMark":"3000"}}

Low Water Mark Configuration :: {"usecplugin:sample-data-lwm": { "samples-lwm":"2000","lowWaterMark-lwm":"2000"}}

=== Administering or Managing Usecplugin-OpenFlow

Use RPC POST APIs in the following format for getting the attack related information.

URI :: http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html#!/usecplugin(2015-01-05)

attackID :: {"usecplugin:input": { "NodeID":"openflow:1"}}

attacksFromIP :: {"usecplugin:input": { "SrcIP":"10.0.0.1"}}

attacksToIP :: {"usecplugin:input": { "DstIP":"10.0.0.2"}}
