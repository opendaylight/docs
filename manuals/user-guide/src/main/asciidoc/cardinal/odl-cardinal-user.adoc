== Cardinal- OpenDaylight Monitoring as a Service
This section describes how to use the Cardinal feature in OpenDaylight
and contains configuration, administration, and management
sections for the feature.

=== Overview
Cardinal (OpenDaylight Monitoring as a Service) enables OpenDaylight and the underlying software defined network to be remotely monitored by deployed Network Management Systems (NMS) or Analytics suite. In the Boron release, Cardinal will add:

. OpenDaylight MIB.
. Enable ODL diagnostics/monitoring to be exposed across SNMP (v2c, v3) and REST north-bound.
. Extend ODL System health, Karaf parameter and feature info, ODL plugin scalability and network parameters.
. Support autonomous notifications (SNMP Traps).


=== Cardinal Architecture

The Cardinal architecture can be found at the below link:

https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/8/89/Cardinal-ODL_Monitoring_as_a_Service_V2.pdf

=== Configuring Cardinal feature
To start Cardinal feature, start karaf and type the following command:

	feature:install odl-cardinal

After this Cardinal should be up and working with snmpdaemon running on port 161.

=== Tutorials
Below are tutorials for Cardinal.

==== Using Cardinal
These tutorials are intended for any user who wants to monitor three basic component in OpenDaylight

. System Info in which controller is running.
. Karaf Info
. Project Specific Information.


===== Prerequisites
There is no as such specific prerequisite. Cardinal can work without installing any third party software. However If one
wants to see the output of a snmpget/snmpwalk on the CLI prompt, than one can install the snmp using the below link:

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-an-snmp-daemon-and-client-on-ubuntu-14-04

Using the above command line utility one can get the same result as the cardinal apis will give for the snmpget/snmpwalk
request.

===== Target Environment
This tutorial is developed considering the following environment:

controller-Linux(Ubuntu 14.02).


===== Instructions

====== Install Cardinal feature
Open karaf and install the cardinal feature using the following command:
	
----
feature:install odl-cardinal
----

Please Verify that Snmp Daemon is up on port 161 using the following command on the terminal window of Linux machine:

----
netstat -anp | grep "161"
----

If the grep on the snmpd port is successfull than snmp daemon is up and working.

======  Apis Reference
Please see Developer guide for usage of Cardinal Apis.

======  CLI commands to do snmpget/walk

One can do Snmpget/walk on the ODL-CARDINAL-MIB. Open the linux terminal and type the below command:

	snmpget -v2c -c public localhost Oid_Of_the_mib_variable

Or

	snmpget -v2c -c public localhost ODL-CARDINAL-MIB::mib_variable_name
