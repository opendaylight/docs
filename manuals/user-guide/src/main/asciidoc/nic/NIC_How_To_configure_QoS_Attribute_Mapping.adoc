==== How to configure QoS Attribute Mapping

This section explains how to provision QoS attribute mapping constraint using NIC OF-Renderer.

The QoS attribute mapping currently supports DiffServ. It uses a 6-bit differentiated services code point (DSCP) in the 8-bit differentiated services field (DS field) in the IP header.

[options="header",cols="20%,80%"]
|===
| Action | Function
|Allow | Permits the packet to be forwarded normally, but allows for packet header fields, e.g., DSCP, to be modified.
|===

The following steps explain QoS Attribute Mapping function:

* Initially configure the QoS profile which contains profile name and DSCP value.
* When a packet is transferred from a source to destination, the flow builder evaluates whether the transferred packet matches the condition such as action, endpoints in the flow.
* If the packet matches the endpoints, the flow builder applies the flow matching action and DSCP value.

===== Requirement

* Before execute the following steps, please, use the default requirements. See section <<NIC_requirements.adoc#,Default Requirements>>.

===== Configuration

Please execute the following CLI commands to test network intent using mininet:

* To apply the QoS constraint, configure the QoS profile.
----
intent:qosConfig -p <qos_profile_name> -d <valid_dscp_value>
----

Example:
----
intent:qosConfig -p High_Quality -d 46
----
NOTE: Valid DSCP value ranges from 0-63.

* To provision the network for the two hosts (h1 and h3), add intents that allows traffic in both directions by execute the following CLI command.

Demonstrates the ALLOW action with constraint QoS and QoS profile name.
----
intent:add -a ALLOW -t <DESTINATION_MAC> -f <SOURCE_MAC> -q QOS -p <qos_profile_name>
----

Example:
----
intent:add -a ALLOW -t 00:00:00:00:00:03 -f 00:00:00:00:00:01 -q QOS -p High_Quality
intent:add -a ALLOW -t 00:00:00:00:00:01 -f 00:00:00:00:00:03 -q QOS -p High_Quality
----

====== Verification

* As we have applied action type ALLOW now ping should happen between hosts h1 and h3.
----
 mininet> h1 ping h3

* Verification of the flow entry and ensuring the mod_nw_tos is part of actions.
