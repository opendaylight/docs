==== Overview

Please refer to the Service Function Chaining project for specifics on SFC provisioning and theory.

*GBP* allows for the use of a chain, by name, in policy.

This takes the form of an _action_ in *GBP*.

Using the <<demo,*GBP* demo and development environment>> as an example:

.GBP and SFC integration environment
image::groupbasedpolicy/sfc-1-topology.png[align="center",width=500]

In the topology above, a symmetrical chain between H35_2 and H36_3 could take path:

H35_2 to sw1 to sff1 to sf1 to sff1 to sff2 to sf2 to sff2 to sw6 to H36_3

If symmetric chaining was desired, the return path is:

.GBP and SFC symmetric chain environment
image::groupbasedpolicy/sfc-2-symmetric.png[align="center",width=500]


If asymmetric chaining was desired, the return path could be direct, or an *entirely different chain*.

.GBP and SFC assymmetric chain environment
image::groupbasedpolicy/sfc-3-asymmetric.png[align="center",width=500]


All these scenarios are supported by the Lithium integration.

In the *Subject Feature Instance* section of the tenant config, we define the instances of the classifier definitions for ICMP and HTTP:
----
        "subject-feature-instances": {
          "classifier-instance": [
            {
              "name": "icmp",
              "parameter-value": [
                {
                  "name": "proto",
                  "int-value": 1
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "name": "http-dest",
              "parameter-value": [
                {
                  "int-value": "6",
                  "name": "proto"
                },
                {
                  "int-value": "80",
                  "name": "destport"
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "name": "http-src",
              "parameter-value": [
                {
                  "int-value": "6",
                  "name": "proto"
                },
                {
                  "int-value": "80",
                  "name": "sourceport"
                }
              ]
            }
          ],
----

Then the action instances to associate to traffic that matches classifiers are defined. 

Note the _SFC chain name_ must exist in SFC, and is validated against
the datastore once the tenant configuration is entered, before entering a valid tenant configuration into the operational datastore (which triggers policy resolution).

----
          "action-instance": [
            {
              "name": "chain1",
              "parameter-value": [
                {
                  "name": "sfc-chain-name",
                  "string-value": "SFCGBP"
                }
              ]
            },
            {
              "name": "allow1",
            }
          ]
        },
----

When ICMP is matched, allow the traffic:

----

        "contract": [
          {
            "subject": [
              {
                "name": "icmp-subject",
                "rule": [
                  {
                    "name": "allow-icmp-rule",
                    "order" : 0,
                    "classifier-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "icmp"
                      }
                    ],
                    "action-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "allow1",
                        "order": 0
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                  
                ]
              },
----

When HTTP is matched, *in* to the provider of the contract with a TCP destination port of 80 (HTTP) or the HTTP request. The chain action is triggered, and similarly 
*out* from the provider for traffic with TCP source port of 80 (HTTP), or the HTTP response.

----
              {
                "name": "http-subject",
                "rule": [
                  {
                    "name": "http-chain-rule-in",
                    "classifier-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "http-dest",
                        "direction": "in"
                      }
                    ],
                    "action-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "chain1",
                        "order": 0
                      }
                    ]
                  },
                  {
                    "name": "http-chain-rule-out",
                    "classifier-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "http-src",
                        "direction": "out"
                      }
                    ],
                    "action-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "chain1",
                        "order": 0
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                ]
              }
----

To enable asymmetrical chaining, for instance, the user desires that HTTP requests traverse the chain, but the HTTP response does not, the HTTP response is set to _allow_ instead of chain:

----

                  {
                    "name": "http-chain-rule-out",
                    "classifier-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "http-src",
                        "direction": "out"
                      }
                    ],
                    "action-ref": [
                      {
                        "name": "allow1",
                        "order": 0
                      }
                    ]
                  }
----
