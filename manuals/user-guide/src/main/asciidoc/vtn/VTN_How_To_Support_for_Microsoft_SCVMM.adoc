==== Support for Microsoft SCVMM 2012 R2 with ODL VTN

===== Introduction

System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) is Microsoft's virtual machine support center for window's based emulations. SCVMM is a management solution for the virtualized data center. You can use it to configure and manage your virtualization host, networking, and storage resources in order to create and deploy virtual machines and services to private clouds that you have created.

The VSEM Provider is a plug-in to bridge between SCVMM and OpenDaylight.

Microsoft Hyper-V is a server virtualization developed by Microsoft, which provides virtualization services through hypervisor-based emulations.

*The topology used in this set-up is:*

* A SCVMM with VSEM Provider installed and a running VTN Coordinator and OpenDaylight with VTN Feature installed.

* PF1000 virtual switch extension has been installed in the two Hyper-V servers as it implements the OpenFlow capability in Hyper-V.

* Three OpenFlow switches simulated using mininet and connected to Hyper-V.

* Four VM's hosted using SCVMM.

*It is implemented as two major components:*

* SCVMM

* OpenDaylight (VTN Feature)

* VTN Coordinator

===== VTN Coordinator

OpenDaylight VTN as Network Service provider for SCVMM where VSEM provider is added in the Network Service which will handle all requests from SCVMM and communicate with the VTN Coordinator. It is used to manage the network virtualization provided by OpenDaylight.

*Create a certificate for web server*

* Execute the following command "openssl ca –in csr.pem –out /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/conf/cert.pem –days 365 –batch" in a single line.

* Enter pass phrase for /etc/pki/CA/private/cakey.pem: Same password you have given in CA's private key PEM pass phrase.

* Open the tomcat file using "vim /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/bin/tomcat".

* Include the line " TOMCAT_PROPS="$TOMCAT_PROPS -Djava.library.path=\"/usr/local/apr/lib\"" " in 131th line and save the file.

*Edit server.xml file and restart the server*

* Open the server.xml file using "vim /usr/local/vtn/tomcat/conf/server.xml" and add the below lines.
+
----
<Connector port="${vtn.port}" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true"
maxThreads="150" scheme="https" secure="true"
SSLCertificateFile="/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/conf/cert.pem"
SSLCertificateKeyFile="/usr/local/vtn/tomcat/conf/key.pem"

===== System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM)

It supports two major features:

* Failover Clustering
* Live Migration

====== Failover Clustering

A single Hyper-V can host a number of virtual machines. If the host were to fail then all of the virtual machines that are running on it will also fail, thereby resulting in a major outage. Failover clustering treats individual virtual machines as clustered resources. If a host were to fail then clustered virtual machines are able to fail over to a different Hyper-V server where they can continue to run.

====== Live Migration

Live Migration is used to migrate the running virtual machines from one Hyper-V server to another Hyper-V server without any interruptions.
