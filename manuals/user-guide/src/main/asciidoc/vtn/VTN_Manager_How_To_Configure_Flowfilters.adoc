==== How To Configure Flowfilters

===== Overview

* This page explains how to provision flowfilter using VTN Manager. This page targets Beryllium release, so the procedure described here does not work in other releases.

* The flow-filter function discards, permits, or redirects packets of the traffic within a VTN, according to specified flow conditions. The table below lists the actions to be applied when a packet matches the condition:

[options="header",cols="30%,70%"]
|===
| Action | Function
| Pass | Permits the packet to pass along the determined path. +
As options, packet transfer priority (set priority) and DSCP change (set ip-dscp) is specified.
| Drop | Discards the packet.
| Redirect | Redirects the packet to a desired virtual interface. +
As an option, it is possible to change the MAC address when the packet is transferred.
|===

* Following steps explain flow-filter function:

** when a packet is transferred to an interface within a virtual network, the flow-filter function evaluates whether the transferred packet matches the condition specifed in the flow-list.

** If the packet matches the condition, the flow-filter applies the flow-list matching action specified in the flow-filter.

===== Requirements

To apply the packet filter, configure the following:

* Create a flow condition.
* Specify where to apply the flow-filter, for example VTN, vBridge, or interface of vBridge.

To provision OpenFlow switches, this page uses Mininet. Mininet details and set-up can be referred at the below page:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Installation#Using_Mininet

Start Mininet, and create three switches (s1, s2, and s3) and four hosts (h1, h2, h3 and h4) in it.

----
sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=192.168.0.100 --topo tree,2
----

NOTE: Replace "192.168.0.100" with the IP address of OpenDaylight controller based on your environment.

You can check the topology that you have created by executing "net" command in the Mininet console.

----
 mininet> net
 h1 h1-eth0:s2-eth1
 h2 h2-eth0:s2-eth2
 h3 h3-eth0:s3-eth1
 h4 h4-eth0:s3-eth2
 s1 lo:  s1-eth1:s2-eth3 s1-eth2:s3-eth3
 s2 lo:  s2-eth1:h1-eth0 s2-eth2:h2-eth0 s2-eth3:s1-eth1
 s3 lo:  s3-eth1:h3-eth0 s3-eth2:h4-eth0 s3-eth3:s1-eth2
----

In this guide, you will provision flowfilters to establish communication between h1 and h3.

NOTE: You need to manually add flow entries to OpenFlow switches in the Mininet. The flow entries are needed to forward packets to controller when there is a table-miss. This configuration is required only in case of OpenFlow 1.3 or using OVS versions (>2.1.1).

----
sudo ovs-ofctl add-flow s1 priority=0,actions=output:CONTROLLER
sudo ovs-ofctl add-flow s2 priority=0,actions=output:CONTROLLER
sudo ovs-ofctl add-flow s3 priority=0,actions=output:CONTROLLER
----

===== Configuration

To provision the virtual L2 network for the two hosts (h1 and h3), execute REST API provided by VTN Manager as follows. It uses curl command to call the REST API.

* Create a virtual tenant named vtn1 by executing
  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/vtn.html#update-vtn[the update-vtn RPC].

----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn:update-vtn -d '{"input":{"tenant-name":"vtn1"}}'
----

* Create a virtual bridge named vbr1 in the tenant vtn1 by executing
  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/vtn-vbridge.html#update-vbridge[the update-vbridge RPC].

----


----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn-vinterface:update-vinterface -d '{"input":{"tenant-name":"vtn1","bridge-name":"vbr1","interface-name":"if2"}}'
----

* Configure two mappings on the interfaces by executing
  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/vtn-port-map.html#set-port-map[the set-port-map RPC].

** The interface if1 of the virtual bridge will be mapped to the port "s2-eth1" of the switch "openflow:2" of the Mininet.

*** The h1 is connected to the port "s2-eth1".

** The interface if2 of the virtual bridge will be mapped to the port "s3-eth1" of the switch "openflow:3" of the Mininet.

*** The h3 is connected to the port "s3-eth1".

----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn-port-map:set-port-map -d '{"input":{"tenant-name":"vtn1", "bridge-name":"vbr1", "interface-name":"if1", "node":"openflow:2", "port-name":"s2-eth1"}}'
----


----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn-port-map:set-port-map -d '{"input":{"tenant-name":"vtn1", "bridge-name":"vbr1", "interface-name":"if2", "node":"openflow:3", "port-name":"s3-eth1"}}'
----

* Create flowcondition named cond_1 by executing
  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/vtn-flow-condition.html#set-flow-condition[the set-flow-condition RPC].

** For option source and destination-network, get inet address of host h1 and h3 from mininet.

----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn-flow-condition:set-flow-condition -d '{"input":{"name":"cond_1", "vtn-flow-match":[{"vtn-ether-match":{},"vtn-inet-match":{"source-network":"10.0.0.1/32","protocol":1,"destination-network":"10.0.0.3/32"},"index":"1"}]}}'
----

* Flowfilter can be applied either in VTN, VBR or VBR Interfaces. Here in this page we provision flowfilter with VBR Interface and demonstrate with action type drop and then pass.

* Flow filter demonstration with DROP action-type. Create Flowfilter in VBR Interface if1 by executing
  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/vtn-flow-filter.html#set-flow-filter[the set-flow-filter RPC].

----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn-flow-filter:set-flow-filter -d '{"input": {"tenant-name": "vtn1", "bridge-name": "vbr1","interface-name":"if1","vtn-flow-filter":[{"condition":"cond_1","vtn-drop-filter":{},"vtn-flow-action":[{"order": "1","vtn-set-inet-src-action":{"ipv4-address":"10.0.0.1/32"}},{"order": "2","vtn-set-inet-dst-action":{"ipv4-address":"10.0.0.3/32"}}],"index": "1"}]}}'
----

===== Verification of the drop filter

* Please execute ping from h1 to h3. As we have applied the action type "drop" , ping should fail with no packet flows between hosts h1 and h3 as below,

----
 mininet> h1 ping h3
----

===== Configuration for pass filter

* Update the flow filter to pass the packets by executing
  https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/vtn/job/vtn-merge-beryllium/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/manager/model/target/site/models/vtn-flow-filter.html#set-flow-filter[the set-flow-filter RPC].

----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/vtn-flow-filter:set-flow-filter -d '{"input": {"tenant-name": "vtn1", "bridge-name": "vbr1","interface-name":"if1","vtn-flow-filter":[{"condition":"cond_1","vtn-pass-filter":{},"vtn-flow-action":[{"order": "1","vtn-set-inet-src-action":{"ipv4-address":"10.0.0.1/32"}},{"order": "2","vtn-set-inet-dst-action":{"ipv4-address":"10.0.0.3/32"}}],"index": "1"}]}}'
----

===== Verification For Packets Success

* As we have applied action type PASS now ping should happen between hosts h1 and h3.

----
 mininet> h1 ping h3
 PING 10.0.0.3 (10.0.0.3) 56(84) bytes of data.
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.3: icmp_req=1 ttl=64 time=0.984 ms
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.3: icmp_req=2 ttl=64 time=0.110 ms
 64 bytes from 10.0.0.3: icmp_req=3 ttl=64 time=0.098 ms
----

* You can also verify the configurations by executing the following REST API. It shows all configuration in VTN Manager.

----
curl --user "admin":"admin" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/vtn:vtns/vtn/vtn1
