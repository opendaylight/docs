=== VTN OpenStack Configuration

This guide describes how to set up OpenStack for integration with OpenDaylight Controller.

While OpenDaylight Controller provides several ways to integrate with OpenStack, this guide focus on the way which uses VTN features available on OpenDaylight. In the integration, VTN Manager work as network service provider for OpenStack.

VTN Manager features, enable OpenStack to work in pure OpenFlow environment in which all switches in data plane are OpenFlow switch.

==== Requirements

* OpenDaylight Controller. (VTN features must be installed)
* OpenStack Control Node.
* OpenStack Compute Node.
* OpenFlow Switch like mininet(Not Mandatory).

The VTN features support multiple OpenStack nodes. You can deploy multiple OpenStack Compute Nodes.
In management plane, OpenDaylight Controller, OpenStack nodes and OpenFlow switches should communicate with each other.
In data plane, Open vSwitches running in OpenStack nodes should communicate with each other through a physical or logical OpenFlow switches. The core OpenFlow switches are not mandatory. Therefore, you can directly connect to the Open vSwitch's.

==== Sample Configuration

Below steps depicts the configuration of single OpenStack Control node and OpenStack Compute node setup. Our test setup is as follows

.LAB Setup
image::vtn/vtn_devstack_setup.png["LAB Setup" ,width= 500]

*Server Preparation*
[horizontal]
- Install Ubuntu 14.04 LTS in two servers (OpenStack Control node and Compute node respectively)
- While installing, Ubuntu mandates creation of a User, we created the user "stack"(We will use the same user for running devstack)
- Proceed with the below mentioned User Settings and Network Settings in both the Control and Compute nodes.

*User Settings for devstack*
- Login to both servers
- Disable Ubuntu Firewall


  sudo ufw disable

- Install the below packages (optional, provides ifconfig and route coammnds, handy for debugging!!)


  sudo apt-get install net-tools

- Edit sudo vim /etc/sudoers and add an entry as follows


  stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

*Network Settings*
- Checked the output of ifconfig -a, two interfaces were listed eth0 and eth1 as indicated in the image above.
- We had connected eth0 interface to the Network where OpenDaylight is reachable.
- eth1 interface in both servers were connected to a different network to act as data plane for the VM's created using the OpenStack.
- Manually edited the file : sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces and made entries as follows


   stack@ubuntu-devstack:~/devstack$ cat /etc/network/interfaces
   # This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
   # and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).
   # The loop-back network interface
   auto lo
   iface lo inet loopback
   # The primary network interface
   auto eth0
   iface eth0 inet static
        address <IP_ADDRESS_TO_REACH_ODL>
        netmask <NET_MASK>
        broadcast <BROADCAST_IP_ADDRESS>
        gateway <GATEWAY_IP_ADDRESS>
  auto eth1
  iface eth1 inet static
       address <IP_ADDRESS_UNIQ>
       netmask <NETMASK>

NOTE: Please ensure that the eth0 interface is the default route and it is able to reach the ODL_IP_ADDRESS
NOTE: The entries for eth1 are not mandatory, If not set, we may have to manually do "ifup eth1" after the stacking is complete to activate the interface

*Finalize the user and network settings*
- Please reboot both nodes after the user and network settings to have the network settings applied to the network
- Login again and check the output of ifconfig to ensure that both interfaces are listed

====  OpenDaylight Settings and Execution

=====  VTN Configuration for OpenStack Integration:

 * VTN uses the configuration parameters from  "90-vtn-neutron.xml" file for the OpenStack integration.
 * These values will be set for the OpenvSwitch, in all the participating OpenStack nodes.
 * A configuration file "90-vtn-neutron.xml" will be generated automatically by following the below steps,
 * Download the latest Beryllium karaf distribution from the below link,


   http://www.opendaylight.org/software/downloads


 * cd "distribution-karaf-0.4.0-Beryllium" and run karaf by using the following command "./bin/karaf".
 * Install the below feature to generate "90-vtn-neutron.xml"

----
 feature:install odl-vtn-manager-neutron
----

 * Logout from the karaf console and Check "90-vtn-neutron.xml" file from the following path "distribution-karaf-0.4.0-Beryllium/etc/opendaylight/karaf/".
 * The contents of "90-vtn-neutron.xml" should be as follows:


bridgename=br-int
portname=eth1
protocols=OpenFlow13
failmode=secure

 * The values of the configuration parameters must be changed based on the user environment.
 * Especially, "portname" should be carefully configured, because if the value is wrong, OpenDaylight fails to forward packets.
 * Other parameters works fine as is for general use cases.
 ** bridgename
 *** The name of the bridge in Open vSwitch, that will be created by OpenDaylight Controller.
 *** It must be "br-int".
 ** portname
 *** The name of the port that will be created in the vbridge in Open vSwitch.
 *** This must be the same name of the interface of OpenStack Nodes which is used for interconnecting OpenStack Nodes in data plane.(in our case:eth1)
 *** By default, if 90-vtn-neutron.xml is not created, VTN uses ens33 as portname.
 ** protocols
 *** OpenFlow protocol through which OpenFlow Switch and Controller communicate.
 *** The values can be OpenFlow13 or OpenFlow10.
 ** failmode
 *** The value can be "standalone" or "secure".
 *** Please use "secure" for general use cases.

===== Start ODL Controller
* Please refer to the Installation Pages to run ODL with VTN Feature enabled.
* After running ODL Controller, please ensure ODL Controller listens to the ports:6633,6653, 6640 and 8080
* Please allow the ports in firewall for the devstack to be able to communicate with ODL Controller.

[NOTE]
====
* 6633/6653 - OpenFlow Ports
* 6640 - OVS Manager Port
* 8080 - Port for REST API
====

====  Devstack Setup

=====  Get Devstack (All nodes)
* Install git application using
** sudo apt-get install git
* Get devstack
** git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack;

===== Verification of Control and Compute Node after VM creation
* Every time a new VM is created, more interfaces are added to the br-int bridge in Open vSwitch.
* Use 'sudo ovs-vsctl show' to list the number of interfaces added.
* Please visit the DLUX GUI to list the new nodes in every switch.

===== Getting started with DLUX
Ensure that you have created a topology and enabled MD-SAL feature in the Karaf distribution before you use DLUX for network management.

===== Logging In
To log in to DLUX, after installing the application:
* Open a browser and enter the login URL. If you have installed DLUX as a stand-alone, then the login URL is http://localhost:9000/DLUX/index.html. However if you have deployed DLUX with Karaf, then the login URL is http://\<your IP\>:8181/dlux/index.html.
* Login to the application with user ID and password credentials as admin.
NOTE:admin is the only user type available for DLUX in this release.

===== Working with DLUX
To get a complete DLUX feature list, install restconf, odl l2 switch, and switch while you start the DLUX distribution.

.DLUX_GUI
image::vtn/Dlux_login.png[DLUX_GUI,width=600]

NOTE: DLUX enables only those modules, whose APIs are responding. If you enable just the MD-SAL in beginning and then start dlux, only MD-SAL related tabs will be visible. While using the GUI if you enable AD-SAL karaf features, those tabs will appear automatically.

===== Viewing Network Statistics
The Nodes module on the left pane enables you to view the network statistics and port information for the switches in the network.
* To use the Nodes module:
** Select Nodeson the left pane.
----
The right pane displays atable that lists all the nodes, node connectors and the statistics.
----
** Enter a node ID in the Search Nodes tab to search by node connectors.
** Click on the Node Connector number to view details such as port ID, port name, number of ports per switch, MAC Address, and so on.
** Click Flows in the Statistics column to view Flow Table Statistics for the particular node like table ID, packet match, active flows and so on.
** Click Node Connectors to view Node Connector Statistics for the particular node ID.

===== Viewing Network Topology
To view network topology:
* Select Topology on the left pane. You will view the graphical representation on the right pane.
----
In the diagram
blue boxes represent the switches,black represents the hosts available, and lines represents how switches are connected.
----
NOTE: DLUX UI does not provide ability to add topology information. The Topology should be created using an open flow plugin. Controller stores this information in the database and displays on the DLUX page, when the you connect to the controller using openflow.
