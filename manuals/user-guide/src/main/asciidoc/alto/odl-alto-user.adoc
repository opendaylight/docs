== ALTO User Guide
There are two user interfaces to ALTO: one for northbound, and one for ALTO
administrator. This user focuses on the second, with a brief introduction 
for the first.

=== ALTO Architecture
To be added.

=== Access ALTO Northbound using an ALTO Client
Accessing ALTO services using a standard ALTO client is easy: follow RFC 7285.
Assume that your OpenDayLight server is the locahost. You can use the following 
curl command to get ALTO info:
curl -u karaf:karaf -X GET -D - http://localhost:8181/controller/nb/v2/alto/

=== Managing ALTO server
If you are the administrator of the ALTO server, you can use the alto CI 
infrastructure to manage the maps store at the ALTO server.
