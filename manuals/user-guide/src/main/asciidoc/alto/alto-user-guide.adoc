== ALTO User Guide ==

=== Overview ===

The ALTO project is aimed to provide support for *Application Layer
Traffic Optimization* services defined in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285[RFC 7285] in Open Daylight.

This user guide will introduce the three basic services (namely
`simple-ird`, `manual-maps` and `host-tracker`) which are implemented in
the Beryllium release, and give instructions on how to configure them to
provide corresponding ALTO services.

=== How to Identify ALTO Resources ===

Each ALTO resource can be uniquely identified by the tuple . For each
resource, a _version-tag_ is used to support historical look-ups.

The formats of _resource-id_ and _version-tag_ are defined in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285#section-10.2[section 10.2] and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285#section-10.3[section 10.3]
respectively. The _context-id_ is not part of the protocol and we choose
the same format as a _universal unique identifier_ (UUID) which is
defined in http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122[RFC 4122].

A context is like a namespace for ALTO resources, which eliminates
_resource-id_ collisions. For simplicity, we also provide a default
context with the id **000000000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000**.

=== How to Use Simple IRD ===

The simple IRD feature provides a simple _information resource
directory_ (IRD) service defined in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285#section-9[RFC 7285].

==== Install the Feature ====

To enable simple IRD, run the following command in the karaf CLI:

[source,bash]
karaf > feature:install odl-alto-simpleird

After the feature is successfully installed, a special context will be
created for all simple IRD resources. The id for this context can be
seen by executing the following command in a terminal:

[source,bash]
curl -X GET -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/alto-simple-ird:information/

==== Create a new IRD ====

To create a new IRD resource, two fields MUST be provided:

* Field **instance-id**: the _resource-id_ of the IRD resource;
* Field **entry-context**: the context-id for non-IRD entries managed by
this IRD resource.

Using the following script, one can create an empty IRD resource:

[source,bash]
#!/bin/bash
# filename: ird-create
INSTANCE_ID=$1
if [ $2 ]; then
    CONTEXT_ID=$2
else
    CONTEXT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
fi
URL="`http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/alto-simple-ird:ird-instance-configuration/"$INSTANCE_ID"/[`http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/alto-simple-ird:ird-instance-configuration/"$INSTANCE_ID"/`]`"
DATA=$(cat template \
  | sed 's/\$1/'$CONTEXT_ID'/g' \
  | sed 's/\$2/'$INSTANCE_ID'/g')
curl -4 -D - -X PUT -u admin:admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$(echo $DATA)"\
  $URL

For example, the following command will create a new IRD named _ird_
which can accept entries with the default context-id:

[source,bash]
$ ./ird-create ird 000000000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000

And below is the what the template file looks like:

[source,json]
{
    "ird-instance-configuration": {
        "entry-context": "/alto-resourcepool:context[alto-resourcepool:context-id='$1']",
        "instance-id": "$2"
    }
}

==== Remove an IRD ====

To remove an existing IRD (and all the entries in it), one can use the
following command in a terminal:

[source,bash]
curl -X DELETE -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/alto-simple-ird:ird-instance-configuration/$INSTANCE_ID

==== Add a new entry ====

There are several ways to add entries to an IRD and in this section we
introduce only the simplest method. Using the following script, one can
add a new entry to the target IRD.

For each new entry, four parameters MUST be provided:

* Parameter __ird-id__: the _resource-id_ of the target IRD;
* Parameter __entry-id__: the _resource-id_ of the ALTO service to be
added;
* Parameter __context-id__: the _context-id_ of the ALTO service to be
added,

which MUST be identical to the target IRD's __entry-context__;

* Parameter __location__: either a URI or a relative path to the ALTO
service.

The following script can be used to add one entry to the target IRD,
where the relative path is used:

[source,bash]
#!/bin/bash
# filename: ird-add-entry
IRD_ID=$1
ENTRY_ID=$2
CONTEXT_ID=$3
BASE_URL=$4
URL="`http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/alto-simple-ird:ird-instance-configuration/"$IRD_ID"/ird-configuration-entry/"$ENTRY_ID"/"
DATA=$(cat template \
  | sed 's/\$1/'$ENTRY_ID'/g' \
  | sed 's/\$2/'$CONTEXT_ID'/g' \
  | sed 's/\$3/'$BASE_URL'/g' )
curl -4 -D - -X PUT -u admin:admin \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "$(echo $DATA)" \
  $URL

For example, the following command will add a new resource named
__networkmap__, whose context-id is the default context-id and the base
URL is /alto/networkmap, to the IRD named __ird__:

[source,bash]
$ ./ird-add-entry ird networkmap 000000000000-0000-0000-0000-00000000 /alto/networkmap

And below is the template file:

[source,json]
{
    "ird-configuration-entry": {
        "entry-id": "$1",
  "instance": "/alto-resourcepool:context[alto-resourcepool:context-id='$2']/alto-resourcepool:resource[alto-resourcepool:resource-id='$1']",
  "path": "$3/$1"
    }
}

==== Remove an entry ====

To remove an entry from an IRD, one can use the following one-line
command:

[source,bash]
curl -X DELETE -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/alto-simple-ird:ird-instance-configuration/$IRD_ID/ird-configuration-entry/$ENTRY_ID/

=== How to Use Host-tracker-based ECS ===

As a real instance of ALTO services, *_alto-hosttracker_* reads data
from *_l2switch_* and generates a network map with resource id
*_hosttracker-network-map_* and a cost map with resource id
**_hostracker-cost-map_**. It can only work with OpenFlow-enabled
networks.

After installing the *_odl-alto-hosttracker_* feature, the corresponding
network map and cost map will be inserted into the data store.

=== Managing Resource with `alto-resourcepool` ===

After installing `odl-alto-release` feature in karaf, `alto-resourcepool` feature 
will be installed automatically. And you can manage all resources in ALTO via 
RESTCONF APIs provided by `alto-resourcepool`.

With the example bash script below you can get any resource infomation in a
given context.

[source,bash]
#!/bin/bash
RESOURCE_ID=$1
if [ $2 ] ; then
	CONTEXT_ID=$2
else
	CONTEXT_ID="00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
fi
URL="http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/alto-resourcepool:context/"$CONTEXT_ID"/alto-resourcepool:resource/"$RESOURCE_ID
curl -X GET -u admin:admin $URL | python -m json.tool | sed -n '/default-tag/p' | sed 's/.*:.*\"\(.*\)\".*/\1/g'

=== Manual Configuration ===

==== Using RESTCONF API ====

After installing `odl-alto-release` feature in karaf, it is possible to manage
network-maps and cost-maps using RESTCONF. Take a look at all the operations
provided by `resource-config` at the API service page which can be found at
`http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html`.

The easiest method to operate network-maps and cost-maps is to modify data broker
via RESTCONF API directly.

==== Using RPC ====

The `resource-config` package also provides a query RPC to config the resources.
You can CREATE, UPDATE and DELETE *network-maps* and *cost-maps* via query RPC.

=== Use Case ===

==== Server Selection ====

One of the key use case for ALTO is server selection. For example, a client (with
IP address 10.0.0.1) sends a data transferring request to Data Transferring Service
(DTS). And there are three data replica servers (with IP address 10.60.0.1, 10.60.0.2
and 10.60.0.3) which can response the request. In this case, DTS can send a query
request to ALTO server to make server selection decision.

Following is an example ALTO query:

[source]
POST /alto/endpointcost HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Type: application/alto-endpointcostparams+json
Accept: application/alto-endpointcost+json,application/alto-error+json
{
  "cost-type": {
    "cost-mode": "ordinal",
    "cost-metric": "hopcount"
  },
  "endpoints": {
    "srcs": [ "ipv4:10.0.0.1" ],
    "dsts": [
      "ipv4:10.60.0.1",
      "ipv4:10.60.0.2",
      "ipv4:10.60.0.3"
  ]
  }
}
