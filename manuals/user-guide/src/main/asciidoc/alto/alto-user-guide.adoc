== ALTO User Guide

=== Overview
The ALTO project provides support for __Application Layer Traffic
Optimization__ services defined in link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7285[RFC
7285].

In the Lithium release, ALTO uses the YANG model described in
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shi-alto-yang-model-03[this draft].

=== ALTO Architecture

There are three kinds of ALTO packages in Open Daylight.

. **Core**
The **core** packages include:
.. `alto-model`: Defines the YANG model of ALTO services in MD-SAL
.. `service-api-rfc7285`: Defines interfaces for ALTO services in AD-SAL
.. `alto-northbound`: Implements the RFC7285-compatible RESTful API
. **Basic**
The **basic** packages include:
.. Basic implementations of ALTO services:
... `alto-provider`: Implements the services defined in `alto-model`
... `simple-impl`: Implements the services defined in `service-api-rfc7285`
.. Utilities:
... `alto-manager`: Provides a karaf command line tool to manipulate network
maps and cost maps.
. **Service**
The **service** packages include:
.. `alto-hosttracker`: Generates a network map, a corresponding cost map and
the endpoint cost service based on `l2switch`.

==== MD-SAL v.s. AD-SAL

Even though MD-SAL is quite useful and there are possibilities that AD-SAL might
be removed from the Open Daylight,
link:https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-shi-alto-yang-model-03[this document] has
pointed out that the format defined in RFC 7285 could not be modelled with YANG.
Thus a middleware is provided to transform the output data structure into
RFC7285-compatible format. The middleware API `service-api-rfc7285` and its
implementation `simple-impl` are now provided in an AD-SAL way but are likely to
be implemented using MD-SAL in the future.

=== Configuring ALTO

There are three packages that require their own configuration files,
including `alto-provider`, `alto-hosttracker` and `simple-impl`. However, the
only configurable option is the type of the data broker in all three
configuration files.

=== Administering or Managing ALTO

To enable ALTO, the features must be installed first.

[source,bash]
karaf > feature:install odl-alto-provider
karaf > feature:install odl-alto-manager
feature:install odl-alto-northbound
feature:install odl-alto-hosttracker

==== Managing Data with RESTCONF

After installing `odl-alto-provider` feature in karaf, it is possible to manage
network-maps and cost-maps using RESTCONF. Take a look at all the operations
provided by `alto-model` at the
link:http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html[API service page].

With the example input below you can insert a network map into the data store,
either by filling the form in the API doc page, or by using tools such as `curl`.

[source,bash]
HOST_IP=localhost                   # IP address of the controller
CREDENTIAL=admin:admin              # username and password for authentication
BASE_URL=$HOST_IP:8181/restconf/config
SERVICE_PATH=alto-service:resources/alto-service:network-maps/alto-service:network-map
RESOURCE_ID=test_odl                # Should match the one in the input file
curl -X PUT -H "content-type:application/yang.data+json" \
		    -d @example-input.json -u $CREDENTIAL \
		    http://$BASE_URL/$SERVICE_PATH/$RESOURCE_ID

[source,json]
include::example-input.json[]

[[read-restconf]]Use the following command to see the results:

[source,bash]
HOST_IP=localhost                   # IP address of the controller
CREDENTIAL=admin:admin              # username and password for authentication
BASE_URL=$HOST_IP:8181/restconf/config
SERVICE_PATH=alto-service:resources/alto-service:network-maps/alto-service:network-map
RESOURCE_ID=test_odl
curl -X GET -u $CREDENTIAL http://$BASE_URL/$SERVICE_PATH/$RESOURCE_ID

Use `DELETE` method to remove the data from the data store.

[source,bash]
HOST_IP=localhost                   # IP address of the controller
CREDENTIAL=admin:admin              # username and password for authentication
BASE_URL=$HOST_IP:8181/restconf/config
SERVICE_PATH=alto-service:resources/alto-service:network-maps/alto-service:network-map
RESOURCE_ID=test_odl
curl -X DELETE -H "content-type:application/yang.data+json" \
               -u $CREDENTIAL http://$BASE_URL/$SERVICE_PATH/$RESOURCE_ID

==== Using `alto-manager`

The `alto-manager` package provides a karaf command line tool which wraps up
the functions described in the last section.

[source,bash]
karaf > alto-create <type> <resource-file>
karaf > alto-delete <type> <resource-id>

Currently only `network-map` and `cost-map` are supported. Also the resource
files used in `alto-manager` follow the RFC7285-compatible format instead of
RESTCONF format.

The following example shows how to use `alto-manager` to put a network map into
the data store.

[source,bash]
karaf > alto-create network-map example-rfc7285-networkmap.json

[source,xml]
include::example-rfc7285-networkmap.json[]

==== Using `alto-hosttracker`

As a real instance of ALTO services, `alto-hosttracker` reads data from
`l2switch` and generates a network map with resource id
`hosttracker-network-map` and a cost map with resource id `hostracker-cost-map`.
It can only work with Openflow-enabled networks.

After installing the `odl-alto-hosttracker` feature, the corresponding network
map and cost map will be inserted into the data store. Follow the steps in
<<read-restconf, how to read data with RESTCONF>> to see the contents.
