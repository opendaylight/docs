=== OVSDB Plugins

==== Overview and Architecture

There are currently two OVSDB Southbound plugins:

* odl-ovsdb-southbound: Implements the OVSDB Open_vSwitch database schema.

* odl-ovsdb-hwvtepsouthbound: Implements the OVSDB hardware_vtep database schema.

These plugins are normally installed and used automatically by higher level applications such as
odl-ovsdb-openstack; however, they can also be installed separately and used via their REST APIs
as is described in the following sections.
