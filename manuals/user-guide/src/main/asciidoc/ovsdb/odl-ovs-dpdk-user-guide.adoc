==== Using OVS with DPDK hosts and OVSDB Netvirt

The Data Plane Development Kit (http://dpdk.org/[DPDK]) is a userspace set
of libraries and drivers designed for fast packet processing.  The userspace
datapath variant of OVS can be built with DPDK enabled to provide the
performance features of DPDK to OVS.  In the 2.4.0 version of OVS, the
Open_vSwtich table schema was enhanced to include the lists 'datapath-types' and
'interface-types'.  When the OVS with DPDK variant of OVS is running, the
'inteface-types' list will include DPDK interface types such as 'dpdk' and 'dpdkvhostuser'.
The OVSDB southbound plugin includes this information in the OVSDB YANG model
in the MD-SAL, so when a specific OVS host is running OVS with DPDK, it is possible
for Netvirt to detect that information by checking that DPDK interface types are
included in the list of supported interface types.

For example, query the operational MD-SAL for OVSDB nodes:

HTTP GET:

 http://ewm-sdn1.jf.intel.com:8181/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/ovsdb:1/

This example illustrates the output of an OVS with DPDK host because
the list of interface types includes types supported by DPDK.

Bridges on OVS with DPDK hosts need to be created with the 'netdev' datapath type
and DPDK specific ports need to be created with the appropriate interface type.
The Opendaylight OVSDB southbound plugin supports these attributes.

The Opendaylight Netvirt application checks whether the OVS host is using OVS with DPDK
when creating the bridges that are expected to be present on the host, e.g. 'br-int'.

Following are some tips for supporting hosts using OVS with DPDK when using Netvirt as the Neutron service
provider and 'devstack' to deploy Openstack.

In addition to the 'networking-odl' ML2 plugin, enable the 'networking-odl-dpdk' plugin in 'local.conf'.

 For working with Openstack Liberty
 enable_plugin networking-odl https://github.com/FedericoRessi/networking-odl integration/liberty
 enable_plugin networking-ovs-dpdk https://github.com/openstack/networking-ovs-dpdk stable/liberty

 For working with Openstack master branch
 enable_plugin networking-odl https://github.com/openstack/networking-odl
 enable_plugin networking-ovs-dpdk https://github.com/openstack/networking-ovs-dpdk

The order of these plugin lines is important.  The 'networking-odl' plugin will install and
setup 'openvswitch'.  The 'networking-ovs-dpdk' plugin will install OVS with DPDK.  Note, the 'networking-ovs-dpdk'
plugin is only being used here to setup OVS with DPDK.  The 'networking-odl' plugin will be used as the Neutron ML2 driver.

For VXLAN tenant network support, the Netvirt application interacts with OVS with DPDK host in the same way as OVS hosts
using the kernel datapath by creating VXLAN ports on 'br-int' to communicate with other tunnel endpoints.  The IP address
for the local tunnel endpoint may be configured in the 'local.conf' file.  For example:

 ODL_LOCAL_IP=192.100.200.10

Netvirt will use this information to configure the VXLAN port on 'br-int'.  On a host with the OVS kernel datapath, it
is expected that there will be a networking interface configured with this IP address.  On an OVS with DPDK host, an OVS
bridge is created and a DPDK port is added to the bridge.  The local tunnel endpoint address is then assigned to the
bridge port of the bridge.  So, for example, if the physical network interface is associated with 'eth0' on the host,
a bridge named 'br-eth0' could be created.  The DPDK port, such as 'dpdk0' (per the naming conventions of OVS with DPDK), is
added to bridge 'br-eth0'.  The local tunnel endpoint address is assigned to the network interface 'br-eth0' which is
attached to bridge 'br-eth0'.  All of this setup is not done by Netvirt.  The 'networking-ovs-dpdk' can be made to
perform this setup by putting configuration like the following in 'local.conf'.

 ODL_LOCAL_IP=192.168.200.9
 ODL_PROVIDER_MAPPINGS=physnet1:eth0,physnet2:eht1
 OVS_DPDK_PORT_MAPPINGS=eth0:br-eth0,eth1:br-ex
 OVS_BRIDGE_MAPPINGS=physnet1:br-eth0,physnet2:br-ex

The above settings associate the host networking interface 'eth0' with bridge 'br-eth0'.  The 'networking-ovs-dpdk' plugin
will determine the DPDK port name associated with 'eth0' and add it to the bridge 'br-eth0'.  If using the Netvirt L3 support,
these settings will enable setup of the 'br-ex' bridge and attach the DPDK port associated with network interface 'eth1' to it.

The following settings are included in 'local.conf' to specify specific attributes associated with OVS with DPDK.  These are
used by the 'networking-ovs-dpdk' plugin to configure OVS with DPDK.

 OVS_DATAPATH_TYPE=netdev
 OVS_NUM_HUGEPAGES=8192
 OVS_DPDK_MEM_SEGMENTS=8192
 OVS_HUGEPAGE_MOUNT_PAGESIZE=2M
 OVS_DPDK_RTE_LIBRTE_VHOST=y
 OVS_DPDK_MODE=compute

Once the stack is up and running virtual machines may be deployed on OVS with DPDK hosts.  The 'networking-odl' plugin handles
ensuring that 'dpdkvhostuser' interfaces are utilized by Nova instead of the default 'tap' interface.  The 'dpdkvhostuser' interface
provides the best performance for VMs on OVS with DPDK hosts.

A Nova flavor is created for VMs that may be deployed on OVS with DPDK hosts.

 nova flavor-create largepage-flavor 1002 1024 4 1
 nova flavor-key 1002 set "hw:mem_page_size=large"

Then, just specify the flavor when creating a VM.

 nova boot --flavor largepage-flavor --image cirros-0.3.4-x86_64-uec --nic net-id=<NET ID VALUE> vm-name
