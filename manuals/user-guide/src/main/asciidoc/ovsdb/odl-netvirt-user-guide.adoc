=== NetVirt

The OVSDB NetVirt project delivers two major pieces of functionality:

. The OVSDB Southbound Protocol, and
. NetVirt, a network virtualization solution.

The following diagram shows the system-level architecture of OVSDB NetVirt in
an OpenStack-based solution.

NetVirt is a network virtualization solution that is a Neutron service provider, and therefore supports
the OpenStack Neutron Networking API and extensions.

The OVSDB component implements the OVSDB protocol (RFC 7047), as well as
plugins to support OVSDB Schemas, such as the Open_vSwitch database schema and
the hardware_vtep database schema.

NetVirt has MDSAL-based interfaces with Neutron on the northbound side, and
OVSDB and OpenFlow plugins on the southbound side.

OVSDB NetVirt currently supports Open vSwitch virtual switches
via OpenFlow and OVSDB.  Work is underway to support hardware gateways.

NetVirt services are enabled by installing the odl-ovsdb-openstack feature using the following command:

 feature:install odl-ovsdb-openstack

To enable NetVirt's distributed Layer 3 routing services, the following line must be uncommented in the etc/custom.properties
file in the OpenDaylight distribution prior to starting karaf:

 ovsdb.l3.fwd.enabled=yes

To start the OpenDaylight controller, run the following application in your distribution:

 bin/karaf
