SXP project is an effort to enhance Opendaylight platform with IP-SGT
bindings that can be learned from connected SXP-aware network nodes.
Current implementation supports SXP protocol version 4 according to the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-smith-kandula-sxp/[Smith, Kandula
- SXP IETF I-D]. All protocol legacy versions 1-3 are supported as well.
Additionally, version 4 adds bidirectional connection type as an
extension of a unidirectional one.

The documentation can be found on project proposal page.
