== OCP Plugin User Guide
This document describes how to use the ORI Control & Management Protocol (OCP)
feature in OpenDaylight. This document contains overview, scope, architecture and
design, installation, configuration and tutorial sections for the feature.

=== Overview
OCP is an ETSI standard protocol for control and management of Remote Radio Head (RRH)
equipment. The OCP Project addresses the need for a southbound plugin that allows
applications and controller services to interact with RRHs using OCP. The OCP southbound
plugin will allow applications acting as a Radio Equipment Control (REC) to interact
with RRHs that support an OCP agent.

It is foreseen that, in 5G, C-RAN will use the packet-based Transport-SDN (T-SDN) as the
fronthaul network to transport both control plane and user plane data between RRHs and
BBUs. As a result, the addition of the OCP plugin to OpenDaylight will make it
possible to build an RRH controller on top of OpenDaylight to centrally manage deployed RRHs,
as well as integrating the RRH controller with T-SDN on one single platform, achieving
the joint RRH and fronthaul network provisioning in C-RAN.

=== Scope
The OCP Plugin project includes:

* OCP v4.1.1 support
* Integration of OCP protocol library
* Simple API invoked as a RPC
* Simple API that allows applications to perform elementary functions of the following categories:
  - Device management
  - Config management
  - Object lifecycle
  - Object state management
  - Fault management
  - Software management (not implemented as of Boron)
* Indication processing
* Logging (not implemented as of Boron)
* AISG/Iuant interface message tunnelling (not implemented as of Boron)
* ALD connection management (not implemented as of Boron)

=== Architecture and Design
OCP is a vendor-neutral standard communications interface defined to enable control and management
between RE and REC of an ORI architecture. The OCP Plugin supports the implementation of the OCP
specification; it is based on the Model Driven Service Abstraction Layer (MD-SAL) architecture.

OCP Plugin will support the following functionality:

* Connection handling
* Session management
* State management
* Error handling
* Connection establishment will be handled by OCP library using opensource netty.io library
* Message handling
* Event/indication handling and propagation to upper layers

*Activities in OCP plugin module*

* Integration with OCP protocol library
* Integration with corresponding MD-SAL infrastructure

OCP protocol library is a component in OpenDaylight that mediates communication between
OpenDaylight controller and RRHs supporting OCP protocol. Its primary goal is to provide
the OCP Plugin with communication channel that can be used for managing RRHs.

Key objectives:

* Immutable transfer objects generation (transformation of OCP protocol library's POJO
objects into OpenDaylight DTO objects)
* Scalable non-blocking implementation
* Pipeline processing
* Scatter buffer
* TLS support

OCP Service addresses the need for a northbound interface that allows applications and other
controller services to interact with RRHs using OCP, by providing API for abstracting OCP operations.

=== Message Flow

=== Installation
The OCP Plugin project has two top level Karaf features, odl-ocpplugin-all and odl-ocpjava-all, which contain the following sub-features:

* odl-ocpplugin-southbound
* odl-ocpplugin-app-ocp-service
* odl-ocpjava-protocol

The OCP service (odl-ocpplugin-app-ocp-service), together with the OCP southbound (odl-ocpplugin-southbound) and OCP protocol library (odl-ocpjava-protocol), provides OpenDaylight with basic OCP v4.1.1 functionality.

There are two ways to interact with OCP service: one is via RESTCONF (programmatic) and the other is using DLUX web interface (manual), so you have to install the following features to enable RESTCONF and DLUX.
----
karaf#>feature:install odl-restconf odl-l2switch-switch odl-mdsal-apidocs odl-dlux-core odl-dlux-all
----
Then install the odl-ocpplugin-all feature which includes the odl-ocpplugin-southbound and odl-ocpplugin-app-ocp-service features. Note that the odl-ocpjava-all feature will be installed automatically as the odl-ocpplugin-southbound feature is dependent on the odl-ocpjava-protocol feature.
----
karaf#>feature:install odl-ocpplugin-all
----
After all required features are installed, use following command from karaf console to check and make sure features are correctly installed and initialized.
----
karaf#>feature:list | grep ocp
----

=== Configuration
Configuring the OCP plugin can be done via its configuration file, 62-ocpplugin.xml, which can be found in the <odl-install-dir>/etc/opendaylight/karaf/ directory.

As of Boron, there are the following settings that are configurable:

. **port** specifies the port number on which the OCP plugin listens for connection requests
. **radioHead-idle-timeout** determines the time duration (unit: milliseconds) for which a radio head has been idle before the idle event is triggered to perform health check
. **ocp-version** specifies the OCP protocol version supported by the OCP plugin
. **rpc-requests-quota** sets the maximum number of concurrent rpc requests allowed
. **global-notification-quota** sets the maximum number of concurrent notifications allowed

=== Test Environment
The OCP Plugin project contains a simple OCP agent for testing purposes; the agent has been designed specifically to act as a fake radio head device, giving you an idea of what it would look like during the OCP handshake taking place between the OCP agent and OpenDaylight (OCP plugin).

To run the simple OCP agent, you have to first download its JAR file from OpenDaylight Nexus Repository.
----
wget https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/opendaylight.release/org/opendaylight/ocpplugin/simple-agent/0.1.0-Boron/simple-agent-0.1.0-Boron.jar
----
Then run the agent with no arguments (assuming you already have JDK 1.8 or above installed) and it should display the usage that lists the expected arguments.
----
java -classpath simple-agent-0.1.0-Boron.jar org.opendaylight.ocpplugin.OcpAgent

Usage: java org.opendaylight.ocpplugin.OcpAgent <controller's ip address> <port number> <vendor id> <serial number>
----
Here is an example:
----
java -classpath simple-agent-0.1.0-Boron.jar org.opendaylight.ocpplugin.OcpAgent 127.0.0.1 1033 XYZ 123
----

=== Web / Graphical Interface
Once you enable the DLUX feature, you can access the Controller GUI using following URL.
----
http://<controller-ip>:8080/index.html
----
Expand Nodes. You should see all the radio head devices that are connected to the controller running at <controller-ip>.

.DLUX Nodes

And expand Yang UI if you want to browse the various northbound APIs exposed by the OCP service.

.DLUX Yang UI

For information on how to use these northbound APIs, please refer to the OCP Plugin Developer Guide.

=== Programmatic Interface
The OCP Plugin project has implemented a complete set of the C&M operations (elementary functions) defined
in the OCP specification, in the form of both northbound and southbound APIs, including:

* health-check
* set-time
* re-reset
* get-param
* modify-param
* create-obj
* delete-obj
* get-state
* modify-state
* get-fault

The API is documented in the OCP Plugin Developer Guide under the section Southbound API and Northbound API, respectively.
