=== NETCONF testtool
*NETCONF testtool is a set of standalone runnable jars that can:*

* Simulate NETCONF devices (suitable for scale testing)
* Stress/Performance test NETCONF devices
* Stress/Performance test RESTCONF devices

These jars are part of OpenDaylight's controller project and are built from the
NETCONF codebase in OpenDaylight.

TIP: Download testtool from OpenDaylight Nexus at: https://nexus.opendaylight.org/content/repositories/public/org/opendaylight/netconf/netconf-testtool/1.0.2-Beryllium-SR2/

*Nexus contains 3 executable tools:*

* executable.jar - device simulator
* stress.client.tar.gz - NETCONF stress/performance measuring tool
* perf-client.jar - RESTCONF stress/performance measuring tool

TIP: Each executable tool provides help. Just invoke +java -jar
<name-of-the-tool.jar> --help+

==== NETCONF device simulator
Detailed information for NETCONF device simulator can be found at: https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/OpenDaylight_Controller:Netconf:Testtool

TODO migrate the guide from wiki here

==== NETCONF stress/performance measuring tool
This is basically a NETCONF client that puts NETCONF servers under
heavy load of NETCONF RPCs and measures the time until a configurable
amount of them is processed.

////
TODO add a guide on how to do this with OpenDaylight

==== RESTCONF stress-performance measuring tool
Very similar to NETCONF stress tool with the difference of using
RESTCONF protocol instead of NETCONF.
