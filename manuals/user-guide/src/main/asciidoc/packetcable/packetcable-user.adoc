== PacketCable User Guide

=== Overview

These components introduce a DOCSIS QoS Gates management using
the PCMM protocol. The driver component is responsible for the
PCMM/COPS/PDP functionality required to service requests from
PacketCable Provider and FlowManager. Requests are transposed into PCMM
Gate Control messages and transmitted via COPS to the CMTS. This plugin
adheres to the PCMM/COPS/PDP functionality defined in the CableLabs
specification. PacketCable solution is an MDSAL compliant component.
