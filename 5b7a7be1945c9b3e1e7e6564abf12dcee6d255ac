Instead use this:\n\n extensions.append(\u0027sphinx_confluence\u0027)\n\nThen for the pip install part add the dependency to the file in docs/requirements.txt.\n\nNote: This is fine here as a one off, but if we want sphinx_confluence to work automatically for all ODL projects we can contribute the changes to the lfdocs-conf project which works as a central configuration for all LFN projects. Let\u0027s try it here with docs first though and if it works well we can move it up.",
