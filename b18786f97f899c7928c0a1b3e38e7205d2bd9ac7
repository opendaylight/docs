      "message": "Abijit asked about this on last TSC call, also recording it here:\n\nHe suggested we add wording to explicitly allow the proxy to be not-a-committer to the project. After thinking about it, I disagree and suggest making the inverse explicit - that the proxy must be a committer to the project. The idea of it being a committer is that they have the power to merge patches, so if the TSC identifies some action the project needs to take they can go and do it right away.",

      "message": "We went with anyone to cover cases where the project was something pulled in as a dependency of another project. Say netconf, whose committers are not active, they could get a proxy from the other projects. In the longer term extra committers should be included to netconf, but that takes time.",

      "message": "In that situation I think the project\u0027s committers not showing up is an important data point for the TSC to gauge that the project is not healthy and needs to have additional committers appointed. Note that they also only have to make 50% of meetings, which is pretty forgiving I think.",
