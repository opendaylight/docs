      "message": "Abijit asked about this on last TSC call, also recording it here:\n\nHe suggested we add wording to explicitly allow the proxy to be not-a-committer to the project. After thinking about it, I disagree and suggest making the inverse explicit - that the proxy must be a committer to the project. The idea of it being a committer is that they have the power to merge patches, so if the TSC identifies some action the project needs to take they can go and do it right away.",
