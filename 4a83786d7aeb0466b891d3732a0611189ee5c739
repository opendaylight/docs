At the moment the page linked from https://docs.opendaylight.org/en/stable-sulfur/ shows the platform versions for Chlorine.\n\nUnfortunately, most MRI projects, except for netconf, do not have document set up for the versions used for Sulfur SR2, so they were kept as latest as well as transportpce \u0026 ovsdb, which don\u0027t have stable-sulfur.",
