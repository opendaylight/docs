It uses version 1.3.0 [2] of jolokia-osgi for Karaf 3.0.8 and 1.3.3 for 4.0.8.\n\nThe difference between jolokia and odl-jolokia is in the default configuration used. Looking at the ODL config file [3] I think we should keep recommending odl-jolokia.\n\nIt may be a good idea to for odl-jolokia to rely on Karaf jolokia as a base, and only override the config. But I do not think that is pressing enough for opening a Bug\n\n\n[0] https://github.com/opendaylight/controller/blob/master/features/extras/src/main/features/features.xml#L21-L25\n\n[1] https://github.com/apache/karaf/blob/karaf-3.0.8/assemblies/features/standard/src/main/feature/feature.xml#L208-L216\n\n[2] https://github.com/apache/karaf/blob/karaf-3.0.8/pom.xml#L155\n\n[3] https://github.com/opendaylight/controller/blob/master/opendaylight/commons/jolokia/src/main/resources/org.jolokia.osgi.cfg",
