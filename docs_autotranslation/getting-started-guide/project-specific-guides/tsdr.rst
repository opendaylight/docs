TSDR Installation Guide
=======================

This document is for the user to install the artifacts that are needed
for using Time Series Data Repository (TSDR) functionality in the ODL
Controller by enabling either an HSQLDB, HBase, or Cassandra Data Store.


Overview
--------

The Time Series Data Repository (TSDR) project in OpenDaylight (ODL) creates a framework for collecting, storing, querying, and maintaining time series data in the OpenDaylight SDN controller. Please refer to the User Guide for the detailed description of the functionality of the project and how to use the corresponding features provided in TSDR.

Pre Requisites for Installing TSDR
----------------------------------

The software requirements for TSDR HBase Data Store are as follows:

* In the case when the user chooses HBase or Cassandra data store, besides the software that ODL requires, we also require HBase and Cassandra database running in single node deployment scenario.

No additional software is required for the HSQLDB Data Stores.

Preparing for Installation
--------------------------

* When using HBase data store,  download HBase from the following website:

 http://archive.apache.org/dist/hbase/hbase-0.94.15/

* When using Cassandra data store, download Cassandra from the following website:

 http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/cassandra/2.1.10/

* No additional steps are required to install the TSDR HSQL Data Store.

Installing TSDR Data Stores
---------------------------

Installing HSQLDB Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once OpenDaylight distribution is up, from karaf console install the HSQLDB data store using the following command::

   feature:install odl-tsdr-hsqldb-all

This will install hsqldb related dependency features (and can take sometime) as well as openflow statistics collector before returning control to the console.


Installing HBase Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing TSDR HBase Data Store contains two steps:

#. Installing HBase server, and
#. Installing TSDR HBase Data Store features from ODL Karaf console.

In Beryllium, we only support HBase single node running together on the same machine as OpenDaylight. Therefore, follow the steps to download and install HBase server onto the same machine as where OpenDaylight is running:

#. Create a folder in Linux operating system for the HBase server. For example, create an hbase directory under ``/usr/lib``::

      mkdir /usr/lib/hbase

#. Unzip the downloaded HBase server tar file.

   Run the following command to unzip the installation package::

      tar xvf <hbase-installer-name>  /usr/lib/hbase

#. Make proper changes in hbase-site.xml

   #. Under <hbase-install-directory>/conf/, there is a hbase-site.xml. Although it is not recommended, an experienced user with HBase can modify the data directory for hbase server to store the data.

   #. Modify the value of the property with name "hbase.rootdir" in the file to reflect the desired file directory for storing hbase data.

      The following is an example of the file::

         <configuration>
           <property>
             <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
             <value>file:///usr/lib/hbase/data</value>
           </property>
           <property>
             <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
             <value>/usr/lib/hbase/zookeeper</value>
           </property>
         </configuration>

#. start hbase server::

      cd <hbase-installation-directory>
      ./start-hbase.sh

#. start hbase shell::

      cd <hbase-insatllation-directory>
      ./hbase shell

#. start Karaf console

#. install hbase data store feature from Karaf console::

       feature:install odl-tsdr-hbase

Installing Cassandra Data Store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing TSDR Cassandra Data Store contains two steps:

#. Installing Cassandra server, and
#. Installing TSDR Cassandra Data Store features from ODL Karaf console.

In Beryllium, we only support Cassadra single node running together on the same machine as OpenDaylight. Therefore, follow these steps to download and install Cassandra server onto the same machine as where OpenDaylight is running:

#. Install Cassandra (latest stable version) by downloading the zip file and untar the tar ball to cassandra/ directory on the testing machine::

      mkdir cassandra
      wget http://www.eu.apache.org/dist/cassandra/2.1.10/apache-cassandra-2.1.10-bin.tar.gz[2.1.10 is current stable version, it can vary]
      mv apache-cassandra-2.1.10-bin.tar.gz cassandra/
      cd cassandra
      tar -xvzf apache-cassandra-2.1.10-bin.tar.gz

#. Start Cassandra from cassandra directory by running::

      ./apache-cassandra-2.1.10/bin/cassandra

#. Start cassandra shell by running::

      ./apache-cassandra-2.1.10/bin/cqlsh

#. Start Karaf according to the instructions above.

#. Install Cassandra data store feature from Karaf console::

      feature:install odl-tsdr-cassandra

Verifying your Installation
---------------------------

After the TSDR data store is installed, no matter whether it is HBase data store, Cassandra data store, or HSQLDB data store, the user can verify the installation with the following steps.

#. Verify if the following two tsdr commands are available from Karaf console::

      tsdr:list
      tsdr:purgeAll

#. Verify if openflow statisitcs data can be received successfully:

   #. Run "feature:install odl-tsdr-openflow-statistics-collector" from Karaf.

   #. Run mininet to connect to ODL controller. For example, use the following command to start a three node topology::

         mn --topo single,3  --controller 'remote,ip=172.17.252.210,port=6653' --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

   #. From Karaf console, the user should be able to retrieve the statistics data of OpenFlow statistics data from the console::

         tsdr:list FLOWSTATS

Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Check the ``../data/log/karaf.log`` for any exception related to TSDR features.

Post Installation Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Post Installation Configuration for HSQLDB Data Store
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The feature installation takes care of automated configuration of the datasource by installing a file in <install folder>/etc named org.ops4j.datasource-metric.cfg. This contains the default location of <install folder>/tsdr where the HSQLDB datastore files are stored. If you want to change the default location of the datastore files to some other location update the last portion of the url property in the org.ops4j.datasource-metric.cfg and then restart the Karaf container.

Post Installation Configuration for HBase Data Store
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Please refer to HBase Data Store User Guide.

Post Installation Configuration for Cassandra Data Store
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

There is no post configuration for TSDR Cassandra data store.

Upgrading From a Previous Release
---------------------------------

The HBase data store was supported in the previous release as well as in this release. However, we do not support data store upgrade for HBase data store.
The user needs to reinstall TSDR and start to collect data in TSDR HBase datastore after the installation.

HSQLDB and Cassandra are new data stores introduced in this release. Therefore, upgrading from previous release does not apply in these two data store scenarios.

Uninstalling TSDR Data Stores
-----------------------------

To uninstall TSDR HSQLDB data store
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To uninstall the TSDR functionality with the default store, you need to do the following from karaf console::

   feature:uninstall odl-tsdr-hsqldb-all
   feature:uninstall odl-tsdr-core
   feature:uninstall odl-tsdr-hsqldb
   feature:uninstall odl-tsdr-openflow-statistics-collector

It is recommended to restart the Karaf container after the uninstallation of the TSDR functionality with the default store.

To uninstall TSDR HBase Data Store
