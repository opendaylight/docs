Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) Services
===========================================================

Overview
--------

Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) is a term for a
framework controlling access to resources, enforcing policies to use
those resources and auditing their usage. These processes are the
fundamental building blocks for effective network management and security.

Authentication provides a way of identifying a user, typically by
having the user enter a valid user name and valid password before access
is granted. The process of authentication is based on each user having a unique
set of criteria for gaining access. The AAA framework compares a user's
authentication credentials with other user credentials stored in a database.
If the credentials match, the user is granted access to the network.
If the credentials don't match, authentication fails and access is denied.

Authorization is the process of finding out what an authenticated user is
allowed to do within the system, which tasks can do, which API can call, etc.
The authorization process determines whether the user has the authority
to perform such actions.

Accounting is the process of logging the activity of an authenticated user,
for example, the amount of data a user has sent and/or received during a
session, which APIs called, etc.

Terms And Definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

AAA
    Authentication, Authorization and Accounting.

Security Framework for AAA services
-----------------------------------

Since Boron release, the OpenDaylight's AAA services are based on the
`Apache Shiro <https://shiro.apache.org/>`_ Java Security Framework. The main
configuration file for AAA is located at “etc/shiro.ini” relative to the
OpenDaylight Karaf home directory.


How to enable AAA
-----------------

AAA is enabled through installing the odl-aaa-shiro feature. The vast majority
of OpenDaylight's northbound APIs (and all RESTCONF APIs) are protected by AAA
by default when installing the +odl-restconf+ feature, since the odl-aaa-shiro
is automatically installed as part of them. In the cases that APIs are *not*
protected by AAA, this will be noted in the per-project release notes.


How to disable AAA
------------------

Edit the “etc/shiro.ini” file and replace the following:

::

    /** = authcBasic

with

::

    /** = anon

Then restart the Karaf process.

AAA Realms
----------

AAA plugin utilizes the Shiro Realms to support pluggable authentication &
authorization schemes. There are two parent types of realms:

-  AuthenticatingRealm

   -  Provides no Authorization capability.

   -  Users authenticated through this type of realm are treated
      equally.

-  AuthorizingRealm

   -  AuthorizingRealm is a more sophisticated AuthenticatingRealm,
      which provides the additional mechanisms to distinguish users
      based on roles.

   -  Useful for applications in which roles determine allowed
      capabilities.

OpenDaylight contains four implementations:

-  TokenAuthRealm

   -  An AuthorizingRealm built to bridge the Shiro-based AAA service
      with the h2-based AAA implementation.

   -  Exposes a RESTful web service to manipulate IdM policy on a
      per-node basis. If identical AAA policy is desired across a
      cluster, the backing data store must be synchronized using an out
      of band method.

   -  A python script located at “etc/idmtool” is included to help
      manipulate data contained in the TokenAuthRealm.

   -  Enabled out of the box. This is the realm configured by default.

-  ODLJndiLdapRealm

   -  An AuthorizingRealm built to extract identity information from IdM
      data contained on an LDAP server.

   -  Extracts group information from LDAP, which is translated into
      OpenDaylight roles.

   -  Useful when federating against an existing LDAP server, in which
      only certain types of users should have certain access privileges.

   -  Disabled out of the box.

-  ODLJndiLdapRealmAuthNOnly

   -  The same as ODLJndiLdapRealm, except without role extraction.
      Thus, all LDAP users have equal authentication and authorization
      rights.

   -  Disabled out of the box.

-  ODLActiveDirectoryRealm

   - Wraps the generic ActiveDirectoryRealm provided by Shiro. This allows for
     enhanced logging as well as isolation of all realms in a single package,
     which enables easier import by consuming servlets.

.. note::

    More than one Realm implementation can be specified. Realms are attempted
    in order until authentication succeeds or all realm sources are exhausted.


TokenAuthRealm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TokenAuthRealm is the default Authorization Realm deployed in OpenDaylight.
TokenAuthRealm uses a direct authentication mechanism as shown in the following
picture:

.. figure:: ./images/aaa/direct-authentication.png
   :alt: TokenAuthRealm direct authentication mechanism

   TokenAuthRealm direct authentication mechanism

A user presents some credentials (e.g., username/password) directly to the
OpenDaylight controller token endpoint /oauth2/token and receives an access
token, which then can be used to access protected resources on the controller.

Configuring TokenAuthRealm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The TokenAuthRealm stores IdM data in an h2 database on each node. Thus,
configuration of a cluster currently requires configuring the desired IdM policy
on each node. There are two supported methods to manipulate the TokenAuthRealm
IdM configuration:

-  idmtool configuration tool

-  RESTful Web Service configuration

**Idmtool**
###########

A utility script located at “etc/idmtool” is used to manipulate the
TokenAuthRealm IdM policy. idmtool assumes a single domain, the default one
(sdn), since multiple domains are not supported in the Boron release. General
usage information for idmtool is derived through issuing the following command:

::

    $ python etc/idmtool -h
    usage: idmtool [-h] [--target-host TARGET_HOST]
                   user
                   {list-users,add-user,change-password,delete-user,list-domains,list-roles,add-role,delete-role,add-grant,get-grants,delete-grant}
                   ...

    positional arguments:
      user                  username for BSC node
      {list-users,add-user,change-password,delete-user,list-domains,list-roles,add-role,delete-role,add-grant,get-grants,delete-grant}
                            sub-command help
        list-users          list all users
        add-user            add a user
        change-password     change a password
        delete-user         delete a user
        list-domains        list all domains
        list-roles          list all roles
        add-role            add a role
        delete-role         delete a role
        add-grant           add a grant
        get-grants          get grants for userid on sdn
        delete-grant        delete a grant

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --target-host TARGET_HOST
                            target host node

**Configuration using the RESTful Web Service**
###############################################

The TokenAuthRealm IdM policy is fully configurable through a RESTful
web service. Full documentation for manipulating AAA IdM data is located
online (https://wiki.opendaylight.org/images/0/00/AAA_Test_Plan.docx),
and a few examples are included in this guide:

Get All Users
'''''''''''''

::

    curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
    OUTPUT:
    {
        "users": [
            {
                "description": "user user",
                "domainid": "sdn",
                "email": "",
                "enabled": true,
                "name": "user",
                "password": "**********",
                "salt": "**********",
                "userid": "user@sdn"
            },
            {
                "description": "admin user",
                "domainid": "sdn",
                "email": "",
                "enabled": true,
                "name": "admin",
                "password": "**********",
                "salt": "**********",
                "userid": "admin@sdn"
            }
        ]
    }

Create a User
'''''''''''''

::

    curl -u admin:admin -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @./user.json http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/users
    PAYLOAD:
    {
        "name": "ryan",
        "userid": "ryan@sdn",
        "password": "ryan",
        "domainid": "sdn",
        "description": "Ryan's User Account",
        "email": "ryandgoulding@gmail.com"
    }

    OUTPUT:
    {
        "userid":"ryan@sdn",
        "name":"ryan",
        "description":"Ryan's User Account",
        "enabled":true,
        "email":"ryandgoulding@gmail.com",
        "password":"**********",
        "salt":"**********",
        "domainid":"sdn"
    }

Create an OAuth2 Token For Admin Scoped to SDN
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

::

    curl -d 'grant_type=password&username=admin&password=a&scope=sdn' http://localhost:8181/oauth2/token

    OUTPUT:
    {
        "expires_in":3600,
        "token_type":"Bearer",
        "access_token":"5a615fbc-bcad-3759-95f4-ad97e831c730"
    }

Use an OAuth2 Token
'''''''''''''''''''

::

    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer 5a615fbc-bcad-3759-95f4-ad97e831c730" http://localhost:8181/auth/v1/domains
    {
        "domains":
        [
            {
                "domainid":"sdn",
                "name":"sdn”,
                "description":"default odl sdn domain",
                "enabled":true
            }
        ]
    }

**Token Store Configuration Parameters**
########################################

Edit the file “etc/opendaylight/karaf/08-authn-config.xml” and edit the
following: .\ **timeToLive**: Configure the maximum time, in milliseconds,
that tokens are to be cached. Default is 360000. Save the file.

ODLJndiLdapRealm
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

LDAP integration is provided in order to externalize identity
management. This configuration allows federation with an external LDAP server.
The user’s OpenDaylight role parameters are mapped to corresponding LDAP
attributes as specified by the groupRolesMap. Thus, an LDAP operator can
provision attributes for LDAP users that support different OpenDaylight role
structures.

Configuring ODLJndiLdapRealm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure LDAP parameters, modify "etc/shiro.ini"
parameters to include the ODLJndiLdapRealm:

::

    # OpenDaylight provides a few LDAP implementations, which are disabled out of the box.
    # ODLJndiLdapRealm includes authorization functionality based on LDAP elements
    # extracted through and LDAP search.  This requires a bit of knowledge about
    # how your LDAP system is setup.  An example is provided below:
    ldapRealm = org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.ODLJndiLdapRealm
    ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=People,dc=DOMAIN,dc=TLD
    ldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://<URL>:389
    ldapRealm.searchBase = dc=DOMAIN,dc=TLD
    ldapRealm.ldapAttributeForComparison = objectClass
    ldapRealm.groupRolesMap = "Person":"admin"
    # ...
    # further down in the file...
    # Stacked realm configuration;  realms are round-robbined until authentication succeeds or realm sources are exhausted.
    securityManager.realms = $tokenAuthRealm, $ldapRealm

ODLJndiLdapRealmAuthNOnly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is useful for setups where all LDAP users are allowed equal access.

Configuring ODLJndiLdapRealmAuthNOnly
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the "etc/shiro.ini" file and modify the following:

::

    ldapRealm = org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.realm.ODLJndiLdapRealm
    ldapRealm.userDnTemplate = uid={0},ou=People,dc=DOMAIN,dc=TLD
    ldapRealm.contextFactory.url = ldap://<URL>:389
    # ...
    # further down in the file...
    # Stacked realm configuration;  realms are round-robbined until authentication succeeds or realm sources are exhausted.
    securityManager.realms = $tokenAuthRealm, $ldapRealm

Authorization Configuration
---------------------------

OpenDaylight supports two authorization engines at present, both of which are
roughly similar in behavior:

- Shiro-Based Authorization

- MDAL-Based Dynamic Authorization

.. note::

    The preferred mechanism for configuring AAA Authentication is the
    MDSAL-Based Dynamic Authorization. Read the following section.

Shiro-Based Static Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenDaylight AAA has support for Role Based Access Control (RBAC) based
on the Apache Shiro permissions system. Configuration of the authorization
system is done off-line; authorization currently cannot be configured
after the controller is started. The Authorization provided by this mechanism
is aimed towards supporting coarse-grained security policies, the MDSAL-Based
mechanism allows for a more robust configuration capabilities. `Shiro-based
Authorization <http://shiro.apache.org/web.html#Web-%7B%7B%5Curls%5C%7D%7D>`_
describes how to configure the Authentication feature in detail.

.. notes::

    The Shiro-Based Authorization that uses the *shiro.ini* URLs section to
    define roles requirements is **deprecated** and **discouraged** since the
    changes made to the file are only honored on a controller restart.

    Shiro-Based Authorization is not **cluster-aware**, so the changes made on
    the *shiro.ini* file have to be replicated on every controller instance
    belonging to the cluster.

    The URL patterns are matched relative to the Servlet context leaving room
    for ambiguity, since many endpoints may match (i.e., "/restconf/modules" and
    "/auth/modules" would both match a "/modules/\**" rule).

Enable “admin” Role Based Access to the IdMLight RESTful web service
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Edit the “etc/shiro.ini” configuration file and add “/auth/v1/\**=
authcBasic, roles[admin]” above the line “/\** = authcBasic” within the
“urls” section.

::

    /auth/v1/** = authcBasic, roles[admin]
    /** = authcBasic

This will restrict the idmlight rest endpoints so that a grant for admin
role must be present for the requesting user.

.. note::

    The ordering of the authorization rules above is important!

MDSAL-Based Dynamic Authorization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The MDSAL-Based Dynamic authorization uses the MDSALDynamicAuthorizationFilter
engine to restrict access to particular URL endpoint patterns. Users may define
a list of policies that are insertion-ordered. Order matters for that list of
policies, since the first matching policy is applied. This choice was made to
emulate behavior of the Shiro-Based Authorization mechanism.

A **policy** is a key/value pair, where the key is a **resource**
(i.e., a "URL pattern") and the value is a list of **permissions** for the
resource. The following describes the various elements of a policy:

- **Resource**: the resource is a string URL pattern as outlined by
  Apache Shiro. For more information, see http://shiro.apache.org/web.html.

- **Description**: an optional description of the URL endpoint and why it is
  being secured.

- **Permissions list**: a list of permissions for a particular policy. If more
  than one permission exists in the permissions list they are evaluated using
  logical "OR". A permission describes the prerequisites to perform HTTP
  operations on a particular endpoint. The following describes the various
  elements of a permission:

  + **Role**: the role required to access the target URL endpoint.
  + **Actions list**: a leaf-list of HTTP permissions that are allowed for a
    Subject possessing the required role.

This an example on how to limit access to the modules endpoint:

::

    HTTP Operation:
    put URL: /restconf/config/aaa:http-authorization/policies

    headers: Content-Type: application/json Accept: application/json

    body:
      { "aaa:policies":
        { "aaa:policies":
          [ { "aaa:resource": "/restconf/modules/**",
            "aaa:permissions": [ { "aaa:role": "admin",
                                   "aaa:actions": [ "get",
                                                    "post",
                                                    "put",
                                                    "patch",
                                                    "delete"
                                                  ]
                                 }
                               ]
            }
          ]
        }
      }

The above example locks down access to the modules endpoint (and any URLS
available past modules) to the "admin" role. Thus, an attempt from the OOB
*admin* user will succeed with 2XX HTTP status code, while an attempt from the
OOB *user* user will fail with HTTP status code 401, as the user *user* is not
granted the "admin" role.

Accounting Configuration
------------------------

Accounting is handled through the standard slf4j logging mechanisms used by the
rest of OpenDaylight. Thus, one can control logging verbosity through
manipulating the log levels for individual packages and classes directly through
the Karaf console, JMX, or etc/org.ops4j.pax.logging.cfg. In normal operations,
the default levels exposed do not provide much information about AAA services;
this is due to the fact that logging can severely degrade performance.

All AAA logging is output to the standard karaf.log file. For debugging purposes
(i.e., to enable maximum verbosity), issue the following command:

::

    log:set TRACE org.opendaylight.aaa

Enable Successful/Unsuccessful Authentication Attempts Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, successful/unsuccessful authentication attempts are NOT logged. This
is due to the fact that logging can severely decrease REST performance.
To enable logging of successful/unsuccessful REST attempts, issue the following
command in Karaf's console:

::

    log:set DEBUG org.opendaylight.aaa.shiro.filters.AuthenticationListener

It is possible to add custom AuthenticationListener(s) to the Shiro-based
configuration, allowing different ways to listen for successful/unsuccessful
authentication attempts. Custom AuthenticationListener(s) must implement
the org.apache.shiro.authc.AuthenticationListener interface.
