P4 Plugin User Guide
====================

Overview
--------

P4 is a high-level language for expressing how packets are processed by the pipeline
of a network forwarding element such as a switch, network processing units, software
switches (bmv2), etc. P4 itself is protocol independent but allows for the expression
of forwarding plane protocols. It is based upon an abstract forwarding model called PISA
(Protocol Independent Switch Architecture). In the Oxygen release, the P4 Plugin project
is aimed to provide basic functions for P4 targets, such as channel and device management,
table population, packet-in and packet-out process, etc.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Forwarding devices must support NETCONF, so that OpenDaylight can connect to them
   and collect resoures via NETCONF.

2. Forwarding devices must support gRpc and run P4 program, so that OpenDaylight
   can set the forwarding pipeline config, complete table entry population and packet
   in/out procedure, etc.
