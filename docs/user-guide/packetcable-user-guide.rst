PacketCable User Guide
======================

Overview
--------

These components introduce a DOCSIS QoS Gates management using the PCMM
protocol. The driver component is responsible for the PCMM/COPS/PDP
functionality required to service requests from PacketCable Provider and
FlowManager. Requests are transposed into PCMM Gate Control messages and
transmitted via COPS to the CMTS. This plugin adheres to the
PCMM/COPS/PDP functionality defined in the CableLabs specification.
PacketCable solution is an MDSAL compliant component.

PacketCable Components
----------------------

PacketCable is comprised of two OpenDaylight bundles:

+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| Bundle                               | Description                          |
+======================================+======================================+
| odl-packetcable-policy-server        | Plugin that provides PCMM model      |
|                                      | implementation based on CMTS         |
|                                      | structure and COPS protocol.         |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+
| odl-packetcable-policy-model         | The Model provided provides a direct |
|                                      | mapping to the underlying QoS Gates  |
|                                      | of CMTS.                             |
+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+

See the PacketCable `YANG
Models <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=packetcable.git;a=tree;f=packetcable-policy-model/src/main/yang>`__.

Installing PacketCable
----------------------

To install PacketCable, run the following ``feature:install`` command
from the Karaf CLI

::

    feature:install odl-packetcable-policy-server-all odl-restconf odl-mdsal-apidocs

Explore and exercise the PacketCable REST API
---------------------------------------------

To see the PacketCable APIs, browse to this URL:
http://localhost:8181/apidoc/explorer/index.html

Replace localhost with the IP address or hostname where OpenDaylight is
running if you are not running OpenDaylight locally on your machine.

.. note::

    Prior to setting any PCMM gates, a CCAP must first be added.

Postman
-------

`Install the Chrome
extension <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en>`__

`Download and import sample packetcable
collection <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=packetcable.git;a=tree;f=packetcable-policy-server/doc/restconf-samples>`__

PacketCable REST API Usage Examples
-----------------------------------

* CCAP "CONFIG" DATASTORE API STRUCTURE

  * Add and view CCAPConfigDatastore(add triggers also the CCAP COPS connection)::

     PUT http://localhost:8181/restconf/config/packetcable:ccaps/ccap/CMTS-1

     {
          "input": {
                "ccapId": "/packetcable:ccaps/packetcable:ccap[packetcable:ccapId='CMTS-1']"

                                          "CMTS-1: CCAP COPS socket is already open"],
                                  "timestamp": "2016-03-23T17:47:29.436-05:00",

                   }
            }
     }

* CCAP OPERATIONAL STATUS - RPC CCAP SET CONNECTION (2) - SHUTDOWN COPS CONNECTION::

     POST http://localhost:8181/restconf/operations/packetcable:ccap-set-connection
     {
          "input": {
                "ccapId": "/packetcable:ccaps/packetcable:ccap[packetcable:ccapId='E6-CTO']",

                   }
            }
     }

.. note::
    A "null" in the error information means that the CCAP connection has been disconnected as a result of a RPC SET.

* GATES "CONFIG" DATASTORE API STRUCTURE CHANGED

  * A CCAP RPC poll returns the gate status info, and also triggers a Operational Datastorestatus update.
  * At a minimum the appIdneeds to be included in the input, subscriberIdand gateIdare optional.
  * A gate status response is only included if the RPC request is done for a specific gate (subscriberIdand gateIdincluded in input).
  * Add and retrieve gates to/from the Config Datastore::

* CCAP OPERATIONAL STATUS - GET GATE STATUS FROM OPERATIONAL DATASTORE

  * Shows the Operational Datastore contents for the gate.
  * The gate status is updated at the time when the gate is configured or during an RPC poll::

     GET http://localhost:8181/restconf/operational/packetcable:qos/apps/app/cto-app/subscribers/subscriber/44.137.0.12/gates/gate/gate88

  * When multiple gates are polled (only appId or appId and subscriberId are provided), a generic response is returned and the Operational Datastore is updated in the background::

     {  "output": {
            "gate": {},
            "response": "cto-app/: gate subtree poll in progress",
            "timestamp": "2016-03-24T13:25:30.471-05:00"
        }
     }
