PacketCable User Guide
======================

Overview
--------

These components introduce a DOCSIS QoS Gates management using the PCMM
protocol. The driver component is responsible for the PCMM/COPS/PDP
functionality required to service requests from PacketCable Provider and
FlowManager. Requests are transposed into PCMM Gate Control messages and
transmitted via COPS to the CMTS. This plugin adheres to the
PCMM/COPS/PDP functionality defined in the CableLabs specification.
PacketCable solution is an MDSAL compliant component.
