BGP is not working...
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* First of all, ensure that all required features are installed, local and remote BGP configuration is correct.

* Check OpenDaylight Karaf logs:

From Karaf console:

.. code-block:: console

   log:tail

or open log file: ``data/log/karaf.log``

Possibly, a reason/hint for a cause of the problem can be found there.

* Try to minimise effect of other OpenDaylight features, when searching for a reason of the problem.

* Try to set DEBUG severity level for BGP logger via Karaf console commands, in order to collect more information:

.. code-block:: console

   log:set DEBUG org.opendaylight.protocol.bgp

.. code-block:: console

   log:set DEBUG org.opendaylight.bgpcep.bgp
