JSON-RPC User Guide
===================

Overview
--------

JSON-RPC 2.0 is a lightweight remote procedure call and notification
specification maintained by jsonrpc.org. OpenDaylight uses the yang
modelled JSON-RPC 2.0 specification as described in the IETF DRAFT:
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yang-json-rpc-00

Supported Transports
--------------------

The JSON-RPC 2.0 plugin in OpenDaylight supports both ODL as server
and as a client with ZMQ. HTTP support will be added in future
versions.

Additional Information
----------------------

The primary intended audience of JSON-RPC 2.0 are developers of interfaces
and extensions to connection OpenDaylight to external systems. For additional
information please see the JSON-RPC 2.0 Developer's guide.
