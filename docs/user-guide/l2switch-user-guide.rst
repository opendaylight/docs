L2 Switch User Guide
====================

Overview
--------

The L2 Switch project provides Layer2 switch functionality.

L2 Switch Architecture
----------------------

-  Packet Handler

   -  Decodes the packets coming to the controller and dispatches them
      appropriately

-  Loop Remover

   -  Removes loops in the network

-  Arp Handler

   -  Handles the decoded ARP packets

-  Address Tracker

   -  Learns the Addresses (MAC and IP) of entities in the network

-  Host Tracker

   -  Tracks the locations of hosts in the network

-  L2 Switch Main

   -  Installs flows on each switch based on network traffic

Configurable parameters in L2 Switch
------------------------------------

The sections below give details about the configuration settings for
the components that can be configured.

The process to change the configuration has been changed with
the introduction of Blueprint in the Boron release. Please
refer to :ref:`l2switch-change-config` for an
example illustrating how to change the configurations.

Configurable parameters in Loop Remover
---------------------------------------

-  l2switch/loopremover/implementation/src/main/yang/loop-remover-config.yang

   -  is-install-lldp-flow

      -  "true" means a flow that sends all LLDP packets to the
         controller will be installed on each switch

      -  "false" means this flow will not be installed

      -  default value is true

   -  lldp-flow-table-id

      -  The LLDP flow will be installed on the specified flow table of
         each switch

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-install-lldp-flow" is set
         to "true"

      -  default value is 0

   -  lldp-flow-priority

      -  The LLDP flow will be installed with the specified priority

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-install-lldp-flow" is set
         to "true"

      -  default value is 100

   -  lldp-flow-idle-timeout

      -  The LLDP flow will timeout (removed from the switch) if the
         flow doesn’t forward a packet for *x* seconds

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-install-lldp-flow" is set
         to "true"

      -  default value is 0

   -  lldp-flow-hard-timeout

      -  The LLDP flow will timeout (removed from the switch) after *x*
         seconds, regardless of how many packets it is forwarding

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-install-lldp-flow" is set
         to "true"

      -  default value is 0

   -  graph-refresh-delay

      -  A graph of the network is maintained and gets updated as
         network elements go up/down (i.e. links go up/down and switches
         go up/down)

      -  After a network element going up/down, it waits
         *graph-refresh-delay* seconds before recomputing the graph

      -  A higher value has the advantage of doing less graph updates,
         at the potential cost of losing some packets because the graph
         didn’t update immediately.

      -  A lower value has the advantage of handling network topology
         changes quicker, at the cost of doing more computation.

      -  default value is 1000

Configurable parameters in Arp Handler
--------------------------------------

-  l2switch/arphandler/src/main/yang/arp-handler-config.yang

   -  is-proactive-flood-mode

      -  "true" means that flood flows will be installed on each switch.
         With this flood flow, each switch will flood a packet that
         doesn’t match any other flows.

         -  Advantage: Fewer packets are sent to the controller because
            those packets are flooded to the network.

         -  Disadvantage: A lot of network traffic is generated.

      -  "false" means the previously mentioned flood flows will not be
         installed. Instead an ARP flow will be installed on each switch
         that sends all ARP packets to the controller.

         -  Advantage: Less network traffic is generated.

         -  Disadvantage: The controller handles more packets (ARP
            requests & replies) and the ARP process takes longer than if
            there were flood flows.

      -  default value is true

   -  flood-flow-table-id

      -  The flood flow will be installed on the specified flow table of
         each switch

         set to "true"

      -  default value is 0

   -  flood-flow-priority

      -  The flood flow will be installed with the specified priority

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "true"

      -  default value is 2

   -  flood-flow-idle-timeout

      -  The flood flow will timeout (removed from the switch) if the
         flow doesn’t forward a packet for *x* seconds

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "true"

      -  default value is 0

   -  flood-flow-hard-timeout

      -  The flood flow will timeout (removed from the switch) after *x*
         seconds, regardless of how many packets it is forwarding

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "true"

      -  default value is 0

   -  arp-flow-table-id

      -  The ARP flow will be installed on the specified flow table of
         each switch

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "false"

      -  default value is 0

   -  arp-flow-priority

      -  The ARP flow will be installed with the specified priority

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "false"

      -  default value is 1

         doesn’t forward a packet for *x* seconds

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "false"

      -  default value is 0

   -  arp-flow-hard-timeout

      -  The ARP flow will timeout (removed from the switch) after
         *arp-flow-hard-timeout* seconds, regardless of how many packets
         it is forwarding

      -  This field is only relevant when "is-proactive-flood-mode" is
         set to "false"

      -  default value is 0

Configurable parameters in Address Tracker
------------------------------------------

-  l2switch/addresstracker/implementation/src/main/yang/address-tracker-config.yang

   -  timestamp-update-interval

      -  A last-seen timestamp is associated with each address. This
         last-seen timestamp will only be updated after
         *timestamp-update-interval* milliseconds.

      -  A higher value has the advantage of performing less writes to
         the database.

      -  A lower value has the advantage of knowing how fresh an address
         is.

      -  default value is 600000

   -  observe-addresses-from

      -  IP and MAC addresses can be observed/learned from ARP, IPv4,

      -  "true" means that the L2 Switch will only be learning addresses.
         No additional flows to optimize network traffic will be
         installed.

      -  "false" means that the L2 Switch will react to network traffic
         and install flows on the switches to optimize traffic.

.. _l2switch-change-config:

Change configuration in L2 Switch
---------------------------------

.. note:: For more information on Blueprint in OpenDaylight, see `this wiki page <https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Using_Blueprint>`_.

The following is an example on how to change the configurations of the L2 Switch components.

**Use Case:** Change the L2 switch from proactive flood mode to reactive mode.

**Option 1:** (external xml file)

#. Navigate to etc folder under download distribution
#. Create following directory structure::

      mkdir - p opendaylight/datastore/initial/config

#. Create a new xml file corresponding to ``<yang module name>_<container name>.xml``::

      vi arp-handler-config_arp-handler-config.xml

#. Add following contents to the created file::

      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
        <arp-handler-config xmlns="urn:opendaylight:packet:arp-handler-config">
        <is-proactive-flood-mode>false</is-proactive-flood-mode>
      </arp-handler-config>

#. Restart the controller which injects the configurations.

**Option 2:** (REST URL)

#. Make the following REST call

   * *URL:* ``http://{{LOCALIP}}:8181/restconf/config/arp-handler-config:arp-handler-config/``
   * *Content-Type:* application/json
   * *Body*::

         {
           "arp-handler-config":
           {
             "is-proactive-flood-mode":false
           }
         }

   * *Expected Result:* 201 Created

#. Restart the controller to see updated configurations. With out a restart
   new configurations will be merged with old configurations which is not desirable.

Running the L2 Switch
---------------------

To run the L2 Switch inside the OpenDaylight distribution simply
install the ``odl-l2switch-switch-ui`` feature;

::

    feature:install odl-l2switch-switch-ui

Create a network using mininet
------------------------------

::

    sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=<Controller IP> --topo=linear,3 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13
    sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --topo=linear,3 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

The above command will create a virtual network consisting of 3
switches. Each switch will connect to the controller located at the
specified IP, i.e. 127.0.0.1

::

    sudo mn --controller=remote,ip=127.0.0.1 --mac --topo=linear,3 --switch ovsk,protocols=OpenFlow13

The above command has the "mac" option, which makes it easier to
distinguish between Host MAC addresses and Switch MAC addresses.

Generating network traffic using mininet
----------------------------------------

::

    h1 ping h2

The above command will cause host1 (h1) to ping host2 (h2)

::

    pingall

*pingall* will cause each host to ping every other host.

Checking Address Observations
-----------------------------

Address Observations are added to the Inventory data tree.

The Address Observations on a Node Connector can be checked through a
browser or a REST Client.

::

    http://10.194.126.91:8080/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/node-connector/openflow:1:1

.. figure:: ./images/l2switch-address-observations.png
   :alt: Address Observations

   Address Observations

Checking Hosts
--------------

Host information is added to the Topology data tree.

-  Host address

-  Attachment point (link) to a node/switch

This host information and attachment point information can be checked
through a browser or a REST Client.

::

    http://10.194.126.91:8080/restconf/operational/network-topology:network-topology/topology/flow:1/

.. figure:: ./images/l2switch-hosts.png
   :alt: Hosts

   Hosts

Checking STP status of each link
--------------------------------

STP Status information is added to the Inventory data tree.

-  A status of "forwarding" means the link is active and packets are
   flowing on it.

-  A status of "discarding" means the link is inactive and packets are
   not sent over it.

The STP status of a link can be checked through a browser or a REST
Client.

::

    http://10.194.126.91:8080/restconf/operational/opendaylight-inventory:nodes/node/openflow:1/node-connector/openflow:1:2

.. figure:: ./images/l2switch-stp-status.png
   :alt: STP status

   STP status

Miscellaneous mininet commands
------------------------------

::

    link s1 s2 down

This will bring the link between switch1 (s1) and switch2 (s2) down

::

    link s1 s2 up

This will bring the link between switch1 (s1) and switch2 (s2) up

::

    link s1 h1 down

This will bring the link between switch1 (s1) and host1 (h1) down
