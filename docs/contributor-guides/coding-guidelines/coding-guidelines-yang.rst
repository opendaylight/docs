Coding Guidelines for YANG
##########################

*Note: This document is a work in progress.*

-  Do not use underscores ('_') in identifiers.
   JDK 9 is on track to making underscores forbidden in identifiers, which means
   we will need to map them and it is not going to be pleasant :-(
-  Each declaration needs to have either a description or a reference to a
   definition document (like an IETF draft)
-  Use ``typedefs`` to declare concepts. An UUID is typeless, so each instance
   should have its scope, so we know its applicability domain.
   'type string' should only be used to things like free-form comments and
   similar. Please attach a 'units' statement whenever possible.
-  TBD
