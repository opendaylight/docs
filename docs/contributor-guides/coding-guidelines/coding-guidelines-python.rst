Coding Guidelines for Python

*Note: This document is a work in progress.*

PEP8 is the Python standard that should be followed when coding any Python code
with the following exceptions.

-  120 characters line length

To automate pep8 scanning we recommend using a ``tox.ini`` configuration file as follows::

   [tox]
   envlist = pep8
   #skipsdist = true  # Command only available in tox 1.6.0

   [testenv:pep8]
   deps = flake8
   commands = flake8

   [flake8]
   max-line-length = 120

Unfortunately the version of tox installed in the Jenkins build infra does not
support the ``skipdist`` parameter which is necessary if your project does not have
a ``setup.py`` file.
A workaround is to create a minimal ``setup.py`` file as follows::

   # Workaround for tox missing parameter 'skipsdist=true' which was not
   # introduced until tox 1.6.0

   import setuptools

   setuptools.setup(name='project-name')
