Description
-----------

Time Series Data Repository (TSDR) project in OpenDaylight (ODL)
contains a time series data repository and a set of time series data
services as MD-SAL services modules that collects, stores, queries and
maintains time series data in Open Daylight deployment environment. This
includes statistics data as well as operational configuration data in
the environment. For example, currently, OpenFlow plugin provides the
capabilities for collecting OpenFlow statistics from OpenFlow enabled
switches that connects to ODL Controller and stores the current value of
the corresponding data in ODL operational data store. As one of TSDR
data collection mechanisms, TSDR will be able to periodically poll the
ODL operational data store to obtain the current value of the data and
store them as time series data into TSDR. For another example,
notification based data collection plugin is under development to
collect various types of statistics data including OpenFlow statistics
and made them available on MD-SAL messaging bus. As one of TSDR data
collection mechanisms, TSDR will be able to subscribe to receive these
data published on MD-SAL messaging bus and store them as time series
data into TSDR. For the data captured in TSDR, northbound interfaces
will be available in ODL northbound APIs for external parties to
retrieve the time series data from the TSDR.

The goal of TSDR project is to create a scalable and extensible
architectural framework for ODL to capture the time series data into a
persistence data store. In this project, we will create a generic and
extensible data model that is optimized for time series data collection,
storage, query, and maintenance. We will also create an abstract and
generic TSDR persistence layer that allows various third party products
to plug in their own implementation of the data store to fit their
needs. As deliverables for the first version of TSDR, we will provide
the example TSDR plugin, which is an HBase TSDR plugin, to realize the
functionality of time series data persistence, query, and maintenance
including data purging and aggregation.

In the project, we will fully utilize MD-SALâ€™s clustering capability to
handle the performance and scalability in time series data processing.
In large deployment scenarios, such as millions of flows being pushed to
TSDR, one or multiple separate MD-SAL instances can be created to focus
on time series data processing, which forms a distributed architecture.
By doing so, we separate the time series data processing logic from the
ODL controller so that the controller could focus on the core
functionality of flow control.

With TSDR functionality being added to ODL, various applications could
be built on top of ODL leveraging the data stored in TSDR over the time
that captures the performance, health, and operational configuration in
ODL environment. This includes applications for security risk detection,
performance analysis, operational configuration optimization, traffic
engineering, and network analytics with automated intelligence.

| \ **Component Diagrams**\
| The following two figures show two deployment scenarios of the TSDR in
  ODL environment. In small to medium deployment scenarios, an
  integrated architecture deploys TS data services together with other
  MD-SAL services of ODL controller in one MD-SAL instance (or server);
  In large deployment scenarios, a distributed architecture deploys TS
  data services into one or multiple separate dedicated MD-SAL instances
  (or servers) so as to handle large amount of data that needs to be
  collected, stored, queried and maintained periodically.

Scope
-----

Following are the components and services that we intend to create in
TSDR project:

| \ **Data Collection Service**\
| Data Collection Service collects time series data in ODL environment.
  In general, there are three ways for collecting data from ODL
  controlled network devices. One is for ODL to periodically poll/query
  the network devices for statistics and operational data, such as
  traditional SNMP data polling. Another approach is for the network
  devices actively pushing data to the controller, such as using NetFlow
  or sFlow protocols. The third one is leveraging the messaging bus for
  the network devices to publish the data to the messaging bus and the
  data collection service would subscribe and receive the corresponding
  data from the messaging bus.

Various southbound plugins will be created to handle different data
being collected using different protocols and mechanisms. These plugins
collect the data and push to ODL data store and/or the controller
messaging bus. Data Collection service will periodically poll/query the
ODL data store to obtain the data or subscribe to the data published by
the southbound plugins onto the messaging bus.

After the data is collected, Data Collection service will inform Data
Storage Service from MD-SAL to store the data into ODL Time Series Data
Repository.

| \ **Data Storage Service**\
| Data Storage Service receives the requests from Data Collection
  Service and constructs Time Series Data Model based on the request
  input data. Then it will call the generic TSDR Data Persistence Layer
  to persist the data into Time Series Data Store. Performance
  optimization needs to be considered in this service including batch
  processing and buffering.

| \ **Time Series Data Model**\
| A generic Time Series Data Model will be created for storing,
  querying, aggregating, and purging of the time series data into
  persistence data store. This data model will be designed for the
  operations on the time series data without addressing the
  implementation details of the underlining data store.

| \ **HBase Time Series Data Repository Plugin**\
| As an example plugin, we will provide a plugin using HBase on top of
  Hadoop clustering system to realize the TSDR functionality in ODL
  environment. The plugin implements the TSDR Persistence APIs to store,
  query, purge, and aggregate data in the time series data repository. A
  schema designed for optimizing the storage and query of the data will
  be provided in the implementation.

| \ **HBase Time Series Data Repository**\
| As an example implementation of time series data repository, we will
  provide an example implementation using HBase on top of Hadoop
  clustering system to realize the TSDR functionality specified in this
  proposal. As a popular column-oriented NoSQL data base, HBase has been
  widely used in the related industry for various applications to handle
  the persistence of large amount of data.

Although we provide HBase as an example implementation, the architecture
and framework this project provides will work with other data stores
such as Cassandra, MongoDB, CouchDB, and among others. In the cases of
using data stores other than HBase, corresponding plugins need to be
created to plug into the generic Time Series Persistence Layer so as to
implement the corresponding APIs for storing, querying, and maintaining
the data in the time series data repository.

| \ **Data Query Service**\
| Upon receiving the API calls from Northbound Interface, Data Query
  Service calls the TSDR Data Persistence API to query the Time Series
  data from TSDR. The API calls will be routed to southbound plugins
  such as HBase TSDR Plugin to process the request and return the
  values. The result will be converted and assembled by Data Query
  Service so as to conform to the Northbound Interface of the ODL
  controller. Performance optimization needs to be considered in this
  service including using various techniques provided from the data
  persistence layer.

| \ **Data Aggregation and Purging Service**\
| Periodically there will be daemon processes at the background to
  provide Data Aggregation and Purging services. The raw historical data
  can be rolled-up to aggregated data and the original raw data could be
  purged from the DB tables to save the storage space as well as improve
  the data query speed with smaller data set. Data Aggregation and
  Purging Services make calls to TSDR Data Persistence API to aggregate
  and purge data from TSDR. The requests will be routed to southbound
  plugins such as HBase TSDR Plugin to complete the operations.

| \ **Time Series Northbound APIs**\
| A set of interfaces will be added into existing ODL Northbound
  Interface for querying time series data from the TSDR. The API
  specification will be provided as project deliverables with URLs,
  request, and response details in json format.
