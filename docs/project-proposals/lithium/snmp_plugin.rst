Description
-----------

Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a popular protocol for
network management. It is used for collecting information from, and
configuring, network devices, such as switches, routers, printers, and
servers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

The SNMP Project address the need for a southbound plugin that allows
applications and controller services to interact with devices using
SNMP. The SNMP southbound plugin will allow applications acting as an
SNMP Manager to interact with devices that support an SNMP agent.

Scope
-----

The SNMP Southbound Plugin project includes:

-  SNMPv1 support

-  SNMPv2 support

-  SNMPv3 support

-  Simple API invoked as a RPC

-  Simple API that allows applications to perform the following
   functions:

#. GetRequest
#. SetRequest
#. GetNextRequest
#. GetBulkRequest
#. Trap support
#. InformRequest

Dependencies
------------

The SNMP project has no dependencies on other projects.
