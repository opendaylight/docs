Description
-----------

The SDW project aims to build an open source platform to control and
manage wireless networks. Its main goal is to make a vendor neutral
software based wireless controller for all APs.

Motivation
----------

Businesses are seeing tremendous demand for mobility and wireless
technology in their enterprise network. We believe that a vendor neutral
platform is needed to control and manage the WLAN devices.

Scope
-----

The scope of this project covers the integration, configuration,
monitoring, management, and control of wireless access points in WLAN
deployments.

1. Control

1.1. RF Monitoring and RF Configuration (Re-TX, Channel Selection, TX
pwr adjustment)

1.2. AP Discovery and AC selection

1.3. Capabilities Negotiations (AP HW, Radio type support..etc)

1.4. Mutual Authentication between AP and AC

1.5. Configuration Status, Statistics exchange

1.6. QOS

2. Dynamic Traffic Management

3. Radio Management (Band, Channel, Steering)

4. Firmware Distribution and Upgrade

5. Policy Management

6. Multitenant
