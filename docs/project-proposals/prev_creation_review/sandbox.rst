Description
-----------

The purpose of this project is to have an area where new developers can
learn the SCM tools and processes without affecting "live" projects. For
developers who have not used Git, Gerrit, and the processes associated
with them, there is no place within ODL for them to do this. This
project would provide a repository and minimal build jobs (verify, merge
and daily) for developers to not only learn the tools, but to test their
Git/Gerrit (review) setups. Currently, if a developer wanted to test
their Git configuration they would have to push a review to an existing
project and if the push succeeded they can abandon the review.

The sample code will be duplicated in a read-only branch which can be
used to refresh the master branch when needed.

Scope
-----

The sandbox project will be part of the main Git repository, and will
use the RelEng build silo. The goal is to have some simple ODL code in
the repo so developers can see how projects are structured.
