Description
-----------

One of the promises of SDN is to enable the network operator have fine
grained control over traffic patterns. Such fine grained control,
especially at a Layer 2-4 flow level, could lead to more efficient
network designs and enable network operators to offer value added
services to their customers. With this background, Dynamic Flow
Management addresses the following problems in an OpenDaylight
framework. The first problem is that of large flow load balancing and
the second one is that of DDoS mitigation.
