Description
-----------

To build a simple portable interface for applications to consume network
infrastructure based on their needs without specifying network
engineering details.

Scope
-----

The proposal is to incrementally build from a small number of simple use
cases to supporting virtually any imagineable use case, a software robot
that can ingest simple, application-centric description of network
intent and automate the process of configuring the available devices and
systems that implement the intent. The project scope includes:

-  Creating a single, extensible NBI that can be used to consume any and
   all services offered from withing the controllers SDN domain.
-  Developing a modular, pluggable software architecture that makes it
   easy to extend the kinds of intent supported without having to
   comprehend all of the logic supporting different models.
-  incrementally building out the support for intent model supporting
   diverse set of use cases.
-  Build advanced intelligence for identifying and resolving intent
   conflicts above the rendering layer
-  Embrace diverse community needs and seek help in inventing, designing
   and implementing an intent system
-  Build advanced intelligence for minimizing changes to device rules in
   response to intent changes.
-  Develop and enforce stong "consumability" requirements to insure a
   solution that appeals to enterprise cloud developers.
