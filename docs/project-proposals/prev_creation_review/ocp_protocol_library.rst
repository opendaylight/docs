OCP Protocol Library

Repo Name
---------

ocpjava

Description
-----------

The OCP Protocol Library will be an implementation of OCP Protocol as
defined in ETSI GS ORI 002-2 Specification v4.1.1. It serves as a basis
for OCP Southbound Plugin.

Motivation
----------

Inspired by the Openflow Protocol Library Project, we feel that
separating the OCP protocol handling from the OCP Southbound Plugin will
be a more elegant design, leading to better code modularity, reusability
and maintainability.

Scope
-----

The scope of OCP Protocol Library includes:

-  Implementation of OCP protocol in Java
-  Support for TCP / TLS connection
