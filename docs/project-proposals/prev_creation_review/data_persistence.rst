Description
-----------

Provide a set of simple contracts for persisting data. Implementation of
the contracts would persist data using different mechanisms and
components that wish to persist data would select the desired
implementation of the contract.

Scope
-----

The initial scope of this project envisions two simple contracts:
SimplePersistence (for simply persisting data) and SearchablePersistence
(for cases where the persisted data would need to be indexed for fast
searching). Any other opendaylight component could make use of these
contracts.
