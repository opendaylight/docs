Description

ModBus is a serial communications protocol for use with programmable

information (temperature, humidity, etc) from the devices (equipped with
PLC) connected in the same network.

allows applications and controller services to interact with devices
using ModBus. OpenDayLight is supposed to be used as a platform for
developing ModBus-based control systems, such as SCADA.
