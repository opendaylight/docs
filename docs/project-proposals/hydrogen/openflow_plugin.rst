Description
-----------

OpenFlow is a vendor-neutral standard communications interface defined
to enable interaction between the control and forwarding layers of an
SDN architecture. The OpenFlow plugin project intends to develop a
plugin to support implementations of the OpenFlow specification as it
develops and evolves. Specifically the project will continue to provide
support for the existing OpenFlow 1.0 implementation, developing a
plugin aiming to support OpenFlow 1.3.x, and further supporting
subsequent OpenFlow specifications. The plugin shall be implemented in
such a way that existing and future OpenFlow protocol specifications can
be integrated and published for the OpenDaylight controller.

Scope
-----

-  Southbound plugin and integration of OpenFlow 1.3.x library project
-  Ongoing support and integration of the OpenFlow specification
-  The plugin should be implemented in an easily extensibile manner
-  Protocol verification activities will be performed on supported
   OpenFlow specifications
