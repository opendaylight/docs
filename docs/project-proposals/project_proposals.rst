Creation Review
===============

instructions
------------

-  Review the `Project
   Lifecycle <http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases>`__
   to get a clear picture of how projects work at OpenDaylight.
-  Edit this page and create a reference for a new page to your proposal

   -  For example, create a reference under the `Proposals Submitted For
      Review <#Proposals_Submitted_For_Review>`__ of the form
      [[Project_Proposals:Foo|The Foo Proposal]]

-  Fill in the page you created describing your proposal.

   -  You can use the fake proposal for the `ABC
      Plugin <Project_Proposals:ABC_Plugin>`__ as a template.
   -  Please indicate if you are planning to contribute existing code,
      or start a new project from scratch.
   -  *Note: It is*\ **very**\ *important that you include both the
      opendaylight account name (i.e. Gerrit User ID) and associated
      email address for all initial committers. This will speed the
      on-boarding process immensely.*

-  send mail to
   `project-proposals <mailto:project-proposals@lists.opendaylight.org>`__
   with a reference to your newly created project proposal page
-  Prepare your existing code for contribution. Suggestions can be found
   `here <Project_Proposals:Code_Prep_Suggestions>`__.
-  Submit your code to the OpenDaylight Foundation for IPR Review by
   contacting `Phil Robb <mailto:probb@linuxfoundation.org>`__.

Guidelines for Creation Review
------------------------------

The last step before your project is formally created is to have a
creation review (See section 2.3.1 of the `Project
Lifecycle <http://www.opendaylight.org/project-lifecycle-releases>`__)
during a `TSC meeting <TSC:Main>`__.

-  You can ask for your creation review to be scheduled for any TSC
   meeting that is more than two weeks after the proposal was e-mailed
   to the
   `project-proposals <mailto:project-proposals@lists.opendaylight.org>`__
   list.

   -  Please e-mail the `tsc <mailto:tsc@lists.opendaylight.org>`__ list
      to schedule the Creation Review.
   -  It may not be possible to schedule the creation review on the
      requested day, the TSC does it's best to accommodate requests.

-  Creation reviews typically last 20â€“30 minutes.

   -  People usually either bring slides or just use their proposal if
      it goes into sufficient detail.
   -  A few diagrams of the major components and how they interact are
      often useful.
   -  If you plan to use slides, please upload them to the wiki ahead of
      time so that people can see them without needing WebEx
      screensharing to work as it's often annoying to get to work on
      Linux.
   -  We conduct the meeting on IRC as well as WebEx, so it's useful to
      have the slides posted to the wiki before the meeting, that way we
      can link them in.
   -  You can find details about both the WebEx and IRC on the `TSC
      page <TSC:Main>`__

-  Common questions that come up are:

   -  Is the committer list complete?
   -  What problem is being solved here? What is the scope of the
      project?
   -  How should we expect it to interact with other related components
      and projects that are already in ODL?
   -  How would an user interact with it? any user story to illustrate?

Guidelines for After Creation Review
------------------------------------

Once your project has been formally approved by the TSC, you'll want to
start getting it set up.

-  Make sure any code you are bringing in goes through IPR Review by
   contacting `Phil Robb <mailto:probb@linuxfoundation.org>`__.
-  Look at the `New Project
   Checklist <GettingStarted:Project_Main#New_Project_Checklist>`__

-  Of particular note, create a main wiki page for your project using
   the `project facts template <Template:Project_Facts>`__ so that
   people can find key information about your project and so that it
   appears in the `Project list <Project_list>`__.

-  The first thing you'll want to do is to email the OpenDaylight
   `helpdesk <mailto:helpdesk@opendaylight.org>`__ with a link to the
   TSC minutes (or TSC list e-mail) showing your creation review
   approval asking for your resources to be set up.
-  After that, you should start working through the tasks on the
   checklist.

-  At the very least, you can set up your main project wiki page with
   the key facts while your infrastructure is being set up.
