Description
-----------

One of the consistent feedback we received from developers was the
complexity in developing apps for OpenDaylight. App developers come from
various backgrounds with varied expertise levels and may not have the
same skillset nor motivation as an OpenDaylight platform developer.
Therefore, we need a lower barrier of entry for developers so that they
are empowered and motivated to invest time in developing apps on
OpenDaylight.

The word "apps" can represent both true applications that makes use of
the existing OpenDaylight infrastructure bundles, development of these
infrastructure components, and more. With some great feedback and input
from the community, few of us have come up with a Maven Archetypes-based
"app template solution" which enables the developers to quickly get
started (< 1 minute) and build their first hello world OpenDaylight
application end to end.

Primer to Maven Archetypes -
https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html

Since OpenDaylight platform developers have the best insight into the
project, if we write these archetypes for various scenarios, then we
will have a rich set of templates readily available. Developers can
simply choose from a catalog of these templates and can develop any kind
of complex apps in a matter of hours, not weeks. Developers can also
publish their own templates to the public template library.

The major objective of this project is to be a repository of these
archetype templates which will host a rich temaplate catalog addressing
various scenarios. With a rich catalog of archetypes, application
development on OpenDaylight will become a breeze.

Scope
-----

Scope of the OpenDaylight Toolkit project includes the following:

-  Repository of Archetypes for various use-cases

   The use-cases may include app development, infrastructure component
   development, southbound plugin development, Custom distribution, user
   interface, northbound APIs, apps using northbound REST APIs, etc.

-  Provide the Archetypes catalog for OpenDaylight
-  In addition to the code and related resources, these Archetype
   templates can also include necessary development toolkits such as
   eclipse launchers, debug helpers, etc.
