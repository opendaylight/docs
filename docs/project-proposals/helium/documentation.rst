Description
-----------

The Documentation project aims to support the OpenDaylight projects with
improved documentation. This project intends to build the content
infrastructure, improve the user content for the various OpenDaylight
projects, and ensure continued quality in the content. This overall
project manages the authoring and publishing process and sets content
policies. Some topics need deeper focus and will be subprojects, as
follows:

Doc Tools Workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project involves the following elements:

-  Set up the repositories, review system, and bug tracking
-  Install the tools needed to author and render content, such as
   ASCIIDoc or DocBook
-  Run a pilot of converting a wiki document to a structured document
-  Implement the appropriate style sheets
-  Determine proper location for published content
-  Document processes, including any training information

Content Conversion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the tools are set up, this project involves the conversion of some
of the wiki content to structured documents. Some of the elements of
this subproject are:

-  Determine appropriate formats for documentation, such as Install
   Guides, Developer Guides, Programmer Guides, and other documentation
   types
-  Prioritize existing content for conversion
-  Convert documents to structured format using the new tools
-  Apply edits and improve content during the conversion process

Wiki Cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Along with developing the structured content, the content on the wiki
should be organized and cleaned up. Parts of the effort include:

-  Categories/taxonomy
-  Templates for consistency
-  Copy edits to improve readability
-  Outreach to contributors to ensure that the content is robust and
   thorough
-  Setting guidelines on wiki usage
