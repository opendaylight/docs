Description
-----------

NAT functionality is one of the basic features of any enterprise network
by which the local IP addresses are translated into global IP addresses
and viceversa for Internet connectivity. This is traditionally done by
the Gateway router in the enterprise network which is connected to the
Service Provider network. In the SDN scenario, this functionality in the
router has to be hosted as an application on the SDN controller (just
like FW application).

Benefits of NAT implementation
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  NAT conserves public Internet address space
-  NAT facilitates network migration from one address space to anothers
-  Enables connecting IoT devices with IPv6 addresses over IPv4 networks
-  NAT simplifies routing
-  Enhances security by masking the private IP addresses and restricting
   connections

Methods of NAT
''''''''''''''

-  One-to-one NAT (Static NAT)
-  One-to-many NAT (Dynamic NAT)
-  Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) or Port Address Translation
   (PAT)
-  Full cone NAT
-  (Address)-restricted-cone NAT
-  Port-restricted cone NAT
-  NAT loopback (Hair pining)
-  Stateful and Stateless NAT64 for Address Family Translation (AFT)
   with IPv6 to IPv4 conversion

UseCase: Network Port Address Translation with ODL in Enterprise Networks
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

In the present project proposal we intend to bring in the NAT
functionality ad a plugin (NATApp plugin) at the ODL controller.
Whenever an enterprise user connects to the Internet with his local IP
address, the NATApp plugin on ODL will translate that local IP address
with a global IP address and installs OpenFlow rules accordingly on the
switch. Nat App installs two flow rules; one for outgoing packet from
and another for incoming to Enterprise network. The first rule will
modify the source IP address from local to global IP address and the
second rule will modify the destination IP address from global IP to
local IP address.

NAT Plugin Interactions with other ODL modules:
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

-  NAT Application shall be created as a modular plugin (OSGI bundle)
   using the MD-SAL approach
-  NAT App registers itself in the Service Abstraction Layer (SAL)
   registry for the consumption of services.
-  NAT App shall listen at SAL for OpenFlow based message notifications
   in network.
-  Create the Yang Data Store and RPCs
-  Expose REST APIâ€™s for North Bound.
-  NAT App offers a solution in the form of L3 plugin.
-  NAT App shall use SQL database for global IP addresses and the
   mapping between global and local IP addresses.
