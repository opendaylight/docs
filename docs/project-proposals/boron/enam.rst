Description
-----------

The OpenDaylight Energy Management plugin implements an abstract
Information Model that describes energy measurement and control features
that may be supported by a variety of device types. The eman plugin may
support a number of southbound interfaces to accommodate a set of
protocols, including but not limited to SNMP, NET-CONF, IPDR. The plugin
presents a northbound REST API. This framework enables any number of
applications to interoperate with any number of devices in order to
measure and optimize energy usage. The Information Model will be
inherited from the SCTE 216 standard â€“ Adaptive Power Systems Interface
Specification (APSIS), which in turn inherits definitions within the
IETF EMAN document set.

Scope
-----

The scope of this project is a stand alone module to extend the
OpenDaylight framework to include energy related measurements and
control features. Energy optimization applications might likely utilize
other OpenDaylight modules to generate a view of devices or perform
other useful functions, but the eman plugin presents no known
dependencies on other modules
