How to Get Help
================

Users and developers can get support from the OpenDaylight community through the
mailing lists, IRC and forums.

#. Create your question on `ServerFault <https://serverfault.com>`_
   or `Stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_ with the tag
   `#opendaylight`.

   .. note:: It is important to `tag <https://stackoverflow.com/help/tagging>`_
             questions correctly to ensure that the questions reach individuals
             subscribed to the tag.

#. Mail ``discuss@lists.opendaylight.org`` or ``dev@lists.opendaylight.org``.

#. Directly mail the PTL as indicated on the specific
   `projects page <https://wiki-archive.opendaylight.org/view/Project_list>`_.

#. IRC: Connect to ``#opendaylight`` or ``#opendaylight-meeting`` channel on ``freenode``.
   The `Linux Foundation's IRC guide <https://docs.releng.linuxfoundation.org/en/latest/freenode.html>`_ may be helpful.
   You'll need `an IRC client <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Internet_Relay_Chat_clients#Operating_system_support>`_,
   or can use `the freenode webchat <https://webchat.freenode.net/#opendaylight>`_,
   or perhaps you'll `like IRCCloud <https://www.irccloud.com>`_.

#. For infrastructure and release engineering queries, mail ``helpdesk@opendaylight.org``.
   IRC: Connect to ``#lf-releng`` channel on ``freenode``.
