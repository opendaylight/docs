======================
Unified Secure Channel
======================

Major Features
==============

* USC Agent provides proxy and agent functionality on top of all standard
  protocols supported by the device. It initiates call-home with the controller,
  maintains live connections with with the controller, acts as a demuxer/muxer
  for packets with the USC header, and authenticates the controller.
* USC Plugin is responsible for communication between the controller and the USC
  agent . It responds to call-home with the controller, maintains live
  connections with the devices, acts as a muxer/demuxer for packets with the USC
  header, and provides support for TLS/DTLS.
* USC Manager handles configurations, high availability, security, monitoring,
  and clustering support for USC.
* USC UI is responsible for displaying a graphical user interface representing
  the state of USC in the OpenDaylight DLUX UI.

Security Considerations
=======================

* USC uses TLS and DTLS to secure the channels. Asymmetric authentication
  handshake when establishing the channels. Mutual authentication achieved with
  certificates configured in usc.properties for both the controller and the
  device.
