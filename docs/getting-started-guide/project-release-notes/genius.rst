Genius (Generic Network Interface, Utilities & Services)
========================================================

Genius project provides Generic Network Interfaces, Utilities & Services. Any ODL application can use these to achieve interference-free co-existence with other applications using Genius. OpendayLight Carbon Genius provides following modules --

* **Interface (logical port) Manager** allows bindings/registration of multiple services to logical ports/interfaces
* **Overlay Tunnel Manager** creates and maintains overlay tunnels between configured tunnel endpoints
* **Aliveness Monitor** provides tunnel/nexthop aliveness monitoring services
* **ID Manager** generates cluster-wide persistent unique integer IDs
* **MD-SAL Utils** provides common generic APIs for interaction with MD-SAL
* **Resource Manager** provides a resource sharing framework for applications sharing common resources e.g. table-ids, group-ids etc.
* **FCAPS Application**  generates various alarms and counters for the different genius modules
* **FCAPS Framework**  module collectively fetches all data generated by fcaps application. Any underlying infrastructure can subscribe for its events to have a generic overview of the various alarms and counters
