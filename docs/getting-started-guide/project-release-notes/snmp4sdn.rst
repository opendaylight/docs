* **Developer Guide(s):**

  * :ref:`snmp4sdn-dev-guide`

Security Considerations
=======================

* The interface or configurable resource exposed to users includes RESTCONF API
  and the switch list file. Switch list file, which is a plain-text file,
  contains security information such as SNMP community.

* SNMP4SDN Plugin configures switches via SNMP protocol, and listens to SNMP
  listen port for link-up/down trap. SNMP v2c is used.

Quality Assurance
=================

* `Link to Sonar Report <https://sonar.opendaylight.org/overview?id=44354>`_ (Test coverage percent NA)
* `Link to CSIT Jobs <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/snmp4sdn/>`_
* Other manual testing and QA information
* For each function of SNMP4SDN Plugin, use REST API to confirm it's
  availability and correctness. Existing functions includes flow configuration
  (such as VLAN and forwarding table) and topology discovery.
