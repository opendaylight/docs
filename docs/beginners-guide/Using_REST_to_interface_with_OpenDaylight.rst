Using REST to Interface to OpenDaylight
***************************************

In this chapter we will discuss REST, the primary interface to interact 
with OpenDaylight via its Northbound interface. Additionally, we will: 

* Give a quick overview of REST itself
* Provide links to learning more on REST
* Provide examples of how to construct basic REST calls using tools such 
  as Linux **curl** utility as well as Google's **Postman** application. 

What is REST
============
REST stands for **representational state transfer** (sometimes spelled "**ReST**") and is a way to communicate with a web-based application such as OpenDaylight. **ReST** typically communicates via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) using standard HTTP verbs such as **GET**, **POST**, **PUT** and **DELETE** that web browsers use to retrieve web pages and to send data to remote servers.

A full tutorial on **ReST** is beyond the scope of this document. However, excellent tutorials on **ReST** can be found on the Internet.  The following links can be used to learn more about **ReST** :

REST Examples
=============
In this section we will take a quick look at some examples of using REST to talk to OpenDaylight.  We will briefly explore making REST calls using:

* The Linux **curl** utility
* Google's **Postman**
* The Python Programming Language
