Connecting to OpenFlow Devices
=============================

In this section we cover the steps necessary to connect OpenDaylight to devices
in your network environment that support the Open protocol(i.e. make OpenDaylight
aware of the nodes in your network.)

.. note:: The text in this section should cover the installation of any and all Karaf features that need to be installed in order to connect OpenDaylight to OpenFlow speaking nodes as well as provide examples of performing basic OpenFlow and OpenvSwitch related operations.
