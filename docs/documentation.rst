Documentation Guide
===================

This guide provides details on how to contribute to the documetantion of
Spectrometer. The style guide we follow for documentation is the python
documentation style guide. See:

    https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html

To build and review the documentation locally you first require to have
installed locally:

* python
* python-tox

Which both should be available in most distribution's package managers.

Then simply run tox and open the html produced via your favourite web browser.

.. code-block:: bash

    tox -edocs
    firefox .tox/docs/tmp/html/index.html
