Documentation Guide
###################

This guide provides details on how to contribute to the OpenDaylight
documentation. OpenDaylight currently uses a mix of AsciiDoc_ and
reStructuredText_ for documentation, although the `Documentation
Group`_ is generally trying to move toward using reStructuredText_ and
Sphinx_ to build it as it is widely-used to provide both HTML and pdf
documentation that can be easily versioned alongside the code. It also
offers similar syntax to Markdown which is familiar to large numbers of
people.

Style Guide
===========

This section serves two purposes:

#. A guide for those writing documentation to follow.
#. A guide for those reviewing documentation.

That being said, assuming that the content is usable, the bias should
be toward merging it rather than blocking on relatively minor edits.

Formatting Preferences
----------------------

In general, the documentation team has focused on trying to make sure
that the instructions are comprehensible, but not being overly pedantic
about these things. Along those lines, while we would prefer the
following, generally they aren't a reason to -1 in and of themselves:

* No trailing whitespace
* Line wrapping at something reasonable, i.e., 72–100 characters

Key terms
---------

* Functionality: something useful a project provides abstractly
* Feature: a Karaf feature that somebody could install
* Project: a project within OpenDaylight, projects ship features to
  provide functionality
* OpenDaylight: this refers to the software we release, use this in
  place of OpenDaylight controller, the OpenDaylight controller, not
  ODL, not ODC

  * Since there is a controller project within OpenDaylight, using
    other terms is hard.

Common writing style mistakes
-----------------------------

* In per-project user documentation, you should never say *git clone*,
  but should assume people have downloaded and installed the controller
  per the getting started guide and start with ``feautre:install
  <something>``
* Avoid statements which are true about part of OpenDaylight, but not
  generally true.

  * For example: "OpenDaylight is a NETCONF controller." It is, but
    that is not all it is.

* In general, developer documentation should target external developers
  to your project so should talk about what APIs you have and how they
  could use them. It *should not* document how to contribute to your
  project.

Grammar Preferences
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Avoid contractions: use cannot instead of can't, it is instead of
  it's, and the like.

Things to get right with spacing and capitalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Note that all of these apply when using them in text. If they are used
as part of URL, class name, or something similar, use the actual
capitalization and spacing.*

* ACL: not Acl or acl
* API: not api
* ARP: not Arp or arp
* datastore: not data store, Data Store, or DataStore (unless it's a
  class/object name)
* IPsec, not IPSEC or ipsec
* IPv4 or IPv6: not Ipv4, Ipv6, ipv4, ipv6, IPV4, or IPV6
* Karaf: not karaf
* Linux: not LINUX or linux
* NETCONF: not Netconf or netconf
* Neutron: not neutron
* OSGi: not osgi or OSGI
* Open vSwitch: not OpenvSwitch, OpenVSwitch, or Open V Switch, etc.
* OpenDaylight: not Opendaylight, Open Daylight, or OpenDayLight, etc.

  * also avoid abbreviations like ODL and ODC

* OpenFlow: not Openflow, Open Flow, openflow, etc.
* OpenStack: not Open Stack or Openstack
* QoS: not Qos, QOS, or qos
* RESTCONF: not Restconf or restconf
* RPC not Rpc or rpc
* URL not Url or url
* VM: not Vm or vm
* YANG: not Yang or yang

reStructuredText-based Documentation
====================================

When using reStructuredText, we try to follow the python documentation
style guide. See: https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html

The best reference for reStrucutedText syntax seems to be the Sphinx
Primer on reStructuredText_.

To build and review the reStructuredText documentation locally you must
have installed locally:

* python
* python-tox

Which both should be available in most distribution's package managers.

Then simply run tox and open the html produced via your favorite web
browser as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/docs
   cd docs
   git submodule update --init
   tox -edocs
   firefox docs/_build/html/index.html

.. note:: Make sure to run `tox -edocs` and not just `tox`. See `Make
          sure you run tox -edocs`_

Directory Structure
-------------------

The directory structure for the reStructuredText documentation is
rooted in the ``docs`` directory inside the ``docs`` ``git``
repository.

Below that there are guides hosted directly in the ``docs`` ``git``
repository and there are guides hosted in remote ``git`` repositories.
Usually those are for project-specific information.

For example here is the directory layout on June, 28th 2016::

   $ tree -L 2
   .
   ├── Makefile
   ├── conf.py
   ├── documentation.rst
   ├── getting-started-guide
   │   ├── api.rst
   │   ├── concepts_and_tools.rst
   │   ├── experimental_features.rst
   │   ├── index.rst
   │   ├── installing_opendaylight.rst
   │   ├── introduction.rst
   │   ├── karaf_features.rst
   │   ├── other_features.rst
   │   ├── overview.rst
   │   └── who_should_use.rst
   ├── index.rst
   ├── make.bat
   ├── opendaylight-with-openstack
   │   ├── images
   │   ├── index.rst
   │   ├── openstack-with-gbp.rst
   │   ├── openstack-with-ovsdb.rst
   │   └── openstack-with-vtn.rst
   └── submodules
       └── releng
           └── builder

The ``getting-started-guide`` and ``opendaylight-with-openstack``
directories correspond to two guides hosted in the ``docs`` repository,
while the ``submodules/releng/builder`` directory houses documentation
for the `RelEng/Builder`_ project.

Inside each guide there is usually an ``index.rst`` file which then
includes other files using a ``toctree`` directive. For example::

   .. toctree::
      :maxdepth: 1

      getting-started-guide/index
      opendaylight-with-openstack/index
      submodules/releng/builder/docs/index

This creates a table of contents on that page where each heading of the
table of contents is the root of the files that are included.

.. note:: When including rst files using ``toctree`` omit the .rst at
          the end of the file name.

Documentation Layout and Style
------------------------------

As mentioned previously we try to follow the python documentation style
guide which defines a few types of sections::

    # with overline, for parts
    * with overline, for chapters
    =, for sections
    -, for subsections
    ^, for subsubsections
    ", for paragraphs

We try to follow the following structure based on that recommendation::

    docs/index.rst                 -> entry point
    docs/____-guide/index.rst      -> part
    docs/____-guide/<chapter>.rst  -> chapter

In the ____-guide/index.rst we use the # with overline at the very top
of the file to determine that it is a part and then within each chapter
file we start the document with a section using * with overline to
denote that it's the chapter heading and then everything in the rest of
the chapter should use::

    =, for sections
    -, for subsections
    ^, for subsubsections
    ", for paragraphs


Troubleshooting
---------------

Make sure you've cloned submodules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you see an error like this::

   ./build-integration-robot-libdoc.sh: line 6: cd: submodules/integration/test/csit/libraries: No such file or directory
   Resource file '*.robot' does not exist.

It means that you haven't pulled down the git submodule for the
integration/test project. The fastest way to do that is::

   git submodule update --init

In some cases, you might wind up with submodules which are somehow
out-of-sync and in that case, the easiest way to fix it is delete the
submodules directory and then re-clone the submodules::

   rm -rf docs/submodules/
   git submodule update --init

.. warning:: This will delete any local changes or information you made
             in the submodules. This should only be the case if you
             manually edited files in that directory.

Make sure you run tox -edocs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you see an error like::

   ERROR:   docs: could not install deps [-rrequirements.txt]; v = InvocationError('/Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/.tox/docs/bin/pip install -rrequirements.txt (see /Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/.tox/docs/log/docs-1.log)', 1)
   ERROR:   docs-linkcheck: could not install deps [-rrequirements.txt]; v = InvocationError('/Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/.tox/docs-linkcheck/bin/pip install -rrequirements.txt (see /Users/ckd/git-reps/docs/.tox/docs-linkcheck/log/docs-linkcheck-1.log)', 1)

It usually means you ran `tox` and not `tox -edocs`, which will result
in running jobs inside submodules which aren't supported by the
environment defined by the `requirements.txt` file in the documentation
tox setup. Just run tox -edocs and it should be fine.

Clear your tox directory and try again
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, tox will not detect when your ``requirements.txt`` file has
changed and so will try to run things without the correct dependencies.
This usually manifests as ``No module named X`` errors or
an ``ExtensionError`` and can be fixed by deleting the ``.tox``
directory and building again::

   rm -rf .tox
   tox -edocs

AsciiDoc-based Documentation
============================

Information on the AsciiDoc tools and build system can be found here:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Documentation/Tools

Directory Structure
-------------------

The AsciiDoc documentation is all located in the ``manuals`` directory
of the ``docs`` ``git`` repository. An example of the directory
structure on June 28th, 2016 can be seen here::

   $ tree -L 4
   .
   ├── common
   │   └── app_support.xml
   ├── developer-guide
   │   ├── pom.xml
   │   └── src
   │       └── main
   │           ├── asciidoc
   │           └── resources
   ├── getting-started-guide
   │   ├── pom.xml
   │   └── src
   │       └── main
   │           ├── asciidoc
   │           └── resources
   ├── howto-openstack
   │   ├── pom.xml
   │   └── src
   │       └── main
   │           ├── asciidoc
   │           └── resources
   ├── pom.xml
   ├── readme
   │   ├── pom.xml
   │   └── src
   │       └── main
   │           └── asciidoc
   └── user-guide
       ├── pom.xml
       └── src
           └── main
               ├── asciidoc
               └── resources

Each of the top-level directories under ``manuals`` is a whole guide by
itself and it contains a ``pom.xml`` file saying how to build it, a
``src/main/asciidoc`` directory with AsciiDoc source files and a
``src/main/resources`` directory containing images.

Troubleshooting
---------------

See `AsciiDoc Tips`_ on the wiki for more information.

Common AsciiDoc mistakes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See also `AsciiDoc Tips`_.

* Lists that get formatted incorrectly because of no blank line above
  the list.
* Numbered lists that are formatted incorrectly and every bullet winds
  up being 1

Migration from AsciiDoc to ReStructuredText
===========================================

Automatically
-------------

In theory, Pandoc_ can convert from DocBook to reStructuredText and we
produce DocBook as part of our build chain from AsciiDoctor. In
practice, for modest-sized migrations doing things by hand works fairly
well.

By Hand
-------

Converting from AsciiDoc to reStructuredText is usually pretty
straightforward and involves looking up the basic syntax for what you
want to do by looking it up in the reStructuredText_ guide.

The differences are usually minor and fast to change.

Also, because of how fast Sphinx builds, and how fast it is to refresh
the HTML documentation rapid iteration is very easy.

Bold/Italics/Verbatim Formatting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is mostly minor syntax issues. In AsciiDoc you do inline
formatting something like this::

   *bold* _italic_ +verbatim+ `verbatim`

In reStructuredText, things are slightly different::

   **bold** *italic* ``verbatim``

Images
^^^^^^

Image formats change from something like::

   .OpenStack Architecture
   image::vtn/OpenStackDeveloperGuide.png["OpenStack Architecture",width=500]

To something like::

   .. figure:: images/dlux-default.png

A helpful regular expression for automating the replacements is
something like::

   search: ^( *)\.(.+)\n +image::(.+)\[(.+),width=(\d+)\]
   replace: $1.. figure:: images/dlux/$3\n$1   :width: $5\n\n$1   $2
