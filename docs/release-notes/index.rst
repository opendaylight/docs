Execution
---------

OpenDaylight includes `Karaf <https://karaf.apache.org>`_ containers, `OSGi <https://www.osgi.org>`_
(Open Service Gateway Initiative) bundles, and Java class files, which are portable and can run on
any Java 11-compliant JVM (Java virtual machine). Any add-on project or feature of a
specific project may have additional requirements.

Development
-----------

OpenDaylight is written in Java and utilizes Maven as a build tool. Therefore,
the only requirements needed to develop projects within OpenDaylight include:

* `Java JDK 11 <https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/products-doc-jdk11certconfig.html>`_
* `Apache Maven <https://maven.apache.org>`_ 3.5.2 or later

If an application or tool is built on top of OpenDaylightâ€™s REST APIs, it does not
have any special requirement beyond what is necessary to run the application or tool
to make REST calls.

In some instances, OpenDaylight uses the `Xtend <https://www.eclipse.org/xtend/>`_ lamguage.
Even though Maven downloads all appropriate tools to build applications; additional plugins
may be required to support IDE.

Projects with additional requirements for execution typically have similar or
additional requirements for development. See the platforms release notes for details.
