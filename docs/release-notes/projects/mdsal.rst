===============================================
Model-Driven Service Abstraction Layer (MD-SAL)
===============================================

Overview
========

MD-SAL provides infrastructure for binding YANG models to Java object model and infrastructure
for providing YANG-defined interaction patterns:
* Reactive datastore update
* RPC and Action invocation
* Notification sourcing and delivery

Behavior/Feature Changes
========================
Java Binding generator core has been rewritten from scratch. This has been coming for a long time
and was finally forced by YANG Tools performance requirements. The implementation now performs
a better-informed analysis of the required mapping, eliminating a large class of issues and allows
us to solve some long-standing failures with strange models encountered in the wild.

Java Bindings generated by this release break compatibility by not generating legacy bridge methods
generated by previous releases shipping in Aluminium and Magnesium.

New Features
============
Netty Replication feature has been promoted to full production status. It is now available as
``odl-mdsal-replicate-netty``.

Deprecated Features
===================
The ability to perform atomic operations on multiple datastores is terminally deprecated and will
be removed in the next major release.

Removed Features
===================
Internal APIs and implementations pertaining to ``DOMDataTreeShard``, ``DataTreeProducer`` and
``DataTreeConsumer`` have been removed. Functionality offered by these is not currently covered
by any construct, but we expect to deliver replacements in near future.
