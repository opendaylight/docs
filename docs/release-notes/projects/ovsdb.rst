=============
OVSDB Project
=============

Overview
========

The OVSDB Project provides the following functionality:

* OVSDB Southbound Plugin handles the OVS device that supports the OVSDB
  schema and uses the OVSDB protocol. This feature provides the implementation
  of the defined YANG models. Developers developing the in-controller application
  and want to leverage OVSDB for device configuration can leverage this functionality.
* HWvTep Southbound Plugin handles the OVS device that supports the OVSDB
  Hardware vTEP schema and uses OVSDB protocol. This feature provides the
  implementation of the project defined YANG models. Developers developing
  the in-controller application and want to leverage OVSDB Hardware vTEP
  plugin for device configuration can leverage this functionality.

Major Features
==============

odl-ovsdb-southbound-api
------------------------

* **Feature URL:** `Southbound API <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=ovsdb.git;a=blob;f=southbound/southbound-features/odl-ovsdb-southbound-api/pom.xml;h=7baad461a78e7dd311516ec03b7dbf7c9a0679aa;hb=refs/heads/stable/sodium>`_
* **Feature Description:** This feature provides the YANG models for northbound users to configure the OVSDB device.
  These YANG models are designed based on the `OVSDB schema <http://openvswitch.org/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.pdf>`_. This
  feature does not provide the implementation of YANG models. If user/developer prefer to write their own implementation
  they can use this feature to load the YANG models in the controller.
* **Top Level:** Yes
* **User Facing:** Yes
* **Experimental:** No
* **CSIT Test:**

  * `Southbound all Sodium <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/ovsdb/job/ovsdb-csit-1node-upstream-southbound-all-sodium/>`_
  * `Clustering <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/ovsdb/job/ovsdb-csit-3node-upstream-clustering-only-sodium/>`_

odl-ovsdb-southbound-impl
-------------------------

* **Feature URL:** `Southbound IMPL <https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=ovsdb.git;a=blob;f=southbound/southbound-features/odl-ovsdb-southbound-impl/pom.xml;h=261a85eacef24c1985a11f60d018816b1f880b10;hb=refs/heads/stable/sodium>`_
* **Feature Description:** This feature is the main feature of the OVSDB Southbound plugin. This plugin handles the OVS
  device that supports the `OVSDB schema <http://openvswitch.org/ovs-vswitchd.conf.db.5.pdf>`_ and uses the
  `OVSDB protocol <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7047>`_. This feature provides the implementation of the defined YANG
  models. Developers developing the in-controller application that want to leverage OVSDB for device configuration can
  add a dependency on this feature and all the required modules will be loaded.
* **Top Level:** Yes
* **User Facing:** No
* **Experimental:** No
* **CSIT Test:**

  * `Southbound all Sodium <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/ovsdb/job/ovsdb-csit-1node-upstream-southbound-all-sodium/>`_

* **Feature Description:** This feature provides the YANG models for northbound users to configure the device
  that supports OVSDB Hardware vTEP schema. These YANG models are designed based on the
  `OVSDB Hardware vTEP schema <https://www.openvswitch.org/support/dist-docs/vtep.5.pdf>`_. This feature does not provide the
  implementation of YANG models. If user/developer prefer to write their own implementation of the defined YANG
  model, they can use this feature to install the  YANG models in the controller.
* **Top Level:** Yes
* **User Facing:** Yes
* **Experimental:** Yes
* **CSIT Test:** Minimal set of CSIT test is already in place. More work is in progress and will have better functional
  coverage in future release: `CSIT <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/Patch-Test/job/ovsdb-patch-test-l2gw-sodium/>`_

Security Considerations
=======================

* Do you have any external interfaces other than RESTCONF?

  * Yes, Southbound Connection to OVSDB/Hardware vTEP devices.

* Other security issues?

  * Plugin's connection to device is by default unsecured. Users need to explicitly
    enable the TLS support through ovsdb library configuration file. Users can refer
    to the wiki page `here <https://wiki-archive.opendaylight.org/view/OVSDB_Integration:TLS_Communication>`_ for the instructions.

Quality Assurance
=================

* `Sonar Report <https://sonar.opendaylight.org/overview/coverage?id=org.opendaylight.ovsdb%3Aovsdb>`_ (57%)
* `CSIT Jobs <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/ovsdb/>`_
* OVSDB southbound plugin is extensively tested through Unit Tests, IT test and system tests. OVSDB southbound plugin
  is tested in both a single-node and three-node cluster setup. Hardware vTEP plugin is currently tested
  through:

  * Unit testing
  * CSIT testing
  * NetVirt project L2 Gateway features CSIT tests
  * Manual testing
