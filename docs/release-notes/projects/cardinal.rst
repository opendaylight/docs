Security Considerations
=======================

* SNMP agent runs on port 161,2001,2003

  * Current support is for SNMPv2c (no encryption or authentication)

* Are all interfaces exposed using RESTCONF?

  * Cardinal supports two interfaces - SNMP and RESTCONF
  * Cardinal REST APIs are RESTCONF (authentication) enabled
  * Cardinal SNMP support is through SNMP Agent (SNMPv2c as mentioned above)
  * :ref:`Link to all RESTCONF API <cardinal-dev-guide>`
