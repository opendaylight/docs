Overview
========

BGP Plugin
----------
The OpenDaylight controller provides an implementation of BGP
(Border Gateway Protocol), which is based on `RFC 4271 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271>`_)
as a south-bound protocol plugin. The implementation renders all
basic *BGP speaker capabilities*, including:

Inter/Intra-AS peering
* Routes advertising
* Routes originating
* Routes storage

The plugin's **north-bound API** (``REST``/``Java``) provides to user:

* Fully dynamic run-time standardized BGP configuration
* Read-only access to all RIBs
* Read-write programmable RIBs
* Read-only reachability/link-state topology view

PCEP Plugin
-----------
The OpenDaylight Path Computation Element Communication Protocol (PCEP)
plugin provides all basic service units necessary to build-up a
PCE-based controller. Defined by `RFC 8231 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8231>`_,
PCEP offers LSP management functionality for Active Stateful PCE, which is
the cornerstone for majority of PCE-enabled SDN solutions. It consists of
the following components:

* Protocol library
* PCEP session handling
* Stateful PCE LSP-DB
* Active Stateful PCE LSP Operations
