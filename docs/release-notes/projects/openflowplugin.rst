     * - **Application**
       - **Description**

     * - **Forwarding Rules Manager**
       -  Application provides functionality to add/remove/update flow/groups/meters.
     * - **LLDP Speaker**
       - Application sends periodic LLDP packet out on each OpenFlow switch port for link discovery.
     * - **Topology LLDP Discovery**
       - Application intercept the LLDP packets and discover the link information.
     * - **Topology Manager**
       - Application receives the discovered links information from Topology LLDP
         Discovery application and stores in the topology yang model datastore.
     * - **Reconciliation Framework**
       - Framework that exposes the APIs that consumer application (in-controller) can
         leverage to participate in the switch reconciliation process in the event of
         switch connection/reconnection.
     * - **Arbitrator Reconciliation**
       - Application exposes the APIs that consumer application or direct user can
         leverage to trigger the device configuration reconciliation.
     * - **OpenFlow Java Library Project**
       - Provides the OpenFlow Java Library that converts the data based on OpenFlow
         plugin data models to the OpenFlow java models before sending it down the
         wire to the device.
     * - **Reconciliation**
       - Reconciles the state using Openflow 1.4 bundles.
