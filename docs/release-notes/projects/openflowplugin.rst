     * - **Topology Manager**
       - Application receives the discovered links information from Topology LLDP

         switch connection/reconnection.
     * - **Arbitrator Reconciliation**
       - Application exposes the APIs that consumer application or direct user can
         leverage to trigger the device configuration reconciliation.
     * - **OpenFlow Java Library Project**
       - Provides the OpenFlow Java Library that converts the data based on OpenFlow
         plugin data models to the OpenFlow java models before sending it down the
         wire to the device.
     * - **Reconciliation**
       - Reconciles the state using OpenFlow 1.4 bundles.
