Security Considerations
=======================

* Switch list file, which is a plain-text file, contains security information such as SNMP community. File access privilege would be carefully set.

* SNMP protocol v2c is used by SNMP4SDN Plugin. SNMP4SDN Plugin configures switches and listens to SNMP
  listen port for link-up/down trap, via SNMP protocol.

Quality Assurance
=================

* `Link to Sonar Report <https://sonar.opendaylight.org/overview?id=44354>`_ (Test coverage percent NA)
* `Link to CSIT Jobs <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/snmp4sdn/>`_
* Other manual testing and QA information
* For each function of SNMP4SDN Plugin, use REST API to confirm it's
  availability and correctness. Existing functions includes flow configuration
  (such as VLAN and forwarding table) and topology discovery.
