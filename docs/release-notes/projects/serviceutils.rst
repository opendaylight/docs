ServiceUtils

Overview
========

The ServiceUtils infrastructure project is a utility to assist in the
operation and maintenance of services provided by OpenDaylight. A service
is a functionality provided by the ODL controller as seen by the operator.
Services can be either networking services (e.g. L2, L3/VPN, NAT, etc.)
or infra services (e.g. OpenFlow). Services are also provided by the different
ODL projects, such as Netvirt, Genius and OpenFlow plugin, and are comprised
of a set of Java Karaf bundles and associated MD-SAL datastores.
