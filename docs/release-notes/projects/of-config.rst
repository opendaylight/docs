Quality Assurance
=================

* Other manual testing and QA information
* Testing methodology. How extensive was it? What should be expected to work?
  What has not been tested as much?
* External System Test is almost done manually, since the sandbox environment
  could not satisfy OF-CONFIG's requirement. The test has covered all external
  APIs of OF-CONFIG and all supplementary options based on OF-CONFIG 1.2.

Migration
---------

* Is it possible to migrate from the previous release? If so, how?

  There is no additional support for migration in OF-CONFIG than there is in
  general. User configuration and state will need to be manually migrated when
  upgrading between major versions of OpenDaylight.
