Security Considerations
=======================

* Do you have any external interfaces other than RESTCONF?

  * Yes, akka uses port 2550 and by default communicates with unencrypted, unauthenticated messages. Securing akka communication isn't described here, but those concerned should look at the "Configuring SSL/TLS for Akka Remoting" section at http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka//2.4.17/scala/remoting.html.

* Other security issues?

  * No

Quality Assurance
=================

* `Link to Sonar Report <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/controller/job/controller-sonar/>`_ (60%)
* `Link to CSIT Jobs <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/controller/>`_

Migration
---------

* Is it possible to migrate from the previous release? If so, how?

  Yes, no specific steps needed unless prior updates to config subsystem modules
  were made via the controller-config yang-ext mount in which case the
  etc/opendaylight/current/controller.currentconfig.xml file must be manually
  edited to remove the following elements corresponding to config yang modules
  that were removed:

    * Remove the <data-broker> element from the <module> element with
      <name> binding-broker-impl
    * Remove the <module> element with <name> inmemory-binding-data-broker
    * Remove the <service> element with <name> binding-data-broker
    * Remove <capability>urn:opendaylight:params:xml:ns:yang:controller:threadpool?module=threadpool&amp;revision=2013-04-09</capability> from <required-capabilities>

  Since the config subsystem is deprecated, it is recommended to migrate any custom
  configuration additions and/or changes contained in controller.currentconfig.xml
  and remove the file.
