Overview
========

AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) are services that help
improve the security posture of an OpenDaylight deployment. By default,
the majority of OpenDaylightâ€™s northbound APIs (and all RESTCONF APIs)
are protected by AAA after installing the ``+odl-restconf+`` feature.
