* **Feature URL:** https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/gitweb?p=bier.git;a=blob;f=features/features-bier/pom.xml;hb=refs/heads/stable/nitrogen
* **Feature Description:**  This is a summary feature containing the default functionalities provided by BIER project.
* **Top Level:** Yes
* **User Facing:** Yes
* **Experimental:** Yes
* **CSIT Test:** https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/bier/job/bier-csit-1node-basic-all-nitrogen/

  *  :ref:`bier-user-guide`

* **Developer Guide(s):**

  *  :ref:`bier-dev-guide`

Security Considerations
=======================

* Do you have any external interfaces other than RESTCONF?

  * BIER project needs to get topology information via BGP-LS and BIER configuration via NETCONF.

* Other security issues?

  * The required security issues are provided in the RESTCONF, NETCONF and BGP-LS projects.

Quality Assurance
=================

* `Link to Sonar Report <https://sonar.opendaylight.org/overview?id=72693>`_ 76.7%
* `Link to CSIT Jobs <https://jenkins.opendaylight.org/releng/view/bier/job/bier-csit-1node-basic-all-nitrogen/>`_
* Testing methodology. How extensive was it? What should be expected to work?
  What has not been tested as much?
* There are unit tests and integration test available under folder "test" and system test in CSIT but the NETCONF
  interface is not tested and will be completed in next release.
