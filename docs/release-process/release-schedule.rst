Release Schedule
================

OpenDaylight releases twice per year, on the Thursdays closest to March 7th and
September 7th.

The six-month aspect of the cadence is designed to synchronize OpenDaylight
releases with OpenStack and OPNFV releases. The closest-Thursday aspect is
designed to cause release events to occur on the same day as TSC meetings.
Dates may be manually adjusted if they conflict with holidays or are otherwise
problematic.
