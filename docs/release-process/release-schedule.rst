Release Schedule
================

OpenDaylight releases twice per year. The six-month cadence is designed to
synchronize OpenDaylight releases with OpenStack and OPNFV releases. Dates
are adjusted to match current resources and requirements from the current
OpenDaylight users. Dates are also adjusted when they conflict with holidays,
overlap with other releases or are otherwise problematic. Dates include the
release of both managed and self-managed projects.
