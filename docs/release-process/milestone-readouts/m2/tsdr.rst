Project Specific:
-----------------

1. Were there any project-specific deliverables planned for this milestone?
   No

2. Have you updated your project facts with the project type category? Yes

3. Do you acknowledge the changes to the RC Blocking Bug Policy [3]_? Yes

.. [1] Note that you can only reasonably hold a project to something if you
       formally asked for it during the release planning process and the project
       team members acknowledged that ask saying they would do it.
.. [2] Release notes must be updated prior to a major release. It is a good idea
       to keep release notes as a living document when significant changes are
       made.
