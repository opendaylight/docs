.. [1] Note that you can only reasonably hold a project to something if you
       formally asked for it during the release planning process and the project
       team members acknowledged that ask saying they would do it.
.. [2] Release notes must be updated prior to a major release. It is a good idea
       to keep release notes as a living document when significant changes are
       made.
