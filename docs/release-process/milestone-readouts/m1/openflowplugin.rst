.. [1] Be sure to read the responsibilities of being a project lead under
       Leadership & Communication in the Requirements for Participation section
       of the release plan:
       https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/Simultaneous_Release:Oxygen_Release_Plan#Requirements_for_Participation
.. [2] Special needs include tools or configuration.  Note that generally, the
       only available tools in CI are basic RHEL/CentOS linux images with Java.
       You should note and ask for anything beyond that here.  Email
       helpdesk@opendaylight.org
.. [3] It is recommended to use the OpenDaylight CI infrastructure unless there
       is some HW or SW resource that cannot be installed there.  Update the
       test plan with explanation on why your top-level features will not be
       using the OpenDaylight CI Infrastructure:
       https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Feature_Integration_System_Test_Template#Test_Infrastructure
.. [4] Projects running system test in external Labs are required to report
       system test results in a timely fashion after release creations, e.g.,
       weekly, RC, and formal releases.  Update the test plan with plans on
       testing in external lab:
       https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Feature_Integration_System_Test_Template#Test_Infrastructure
