[1] https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/GettingStarted:Project_Main#New_Project_Checklist

[2] Special needs include tools or configuration.  Note that generally, the only available tools in
CI are basic RHEL/CentOS linux images with Java. You should note and ask for anything beyond that
here.  Email helpdesk@opendaylight.org

[3] It is recommended to use the OpenDaylight CI infrastructure unless there is some HW or SW
resource that cannot be installed there.  Update the test plan with explanation on why your
top-level features will not be using the OpenDaylight CI Infrastructure:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Feature_Integration_System_Test_Template#Test_Infrastructure

[4] Projects running system test in external Labs are required to report system test results in a
timely fashion after release creations, e.g., weekly, RC, and formal releases.  Update the test
plan with plans on testing in external lab:
https://wiki.opendaylight.org/view/CrossProject:Integration_Group:Feature_Integration_System_Test_Template#Test_Infrastructure
