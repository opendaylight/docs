Simultaneous Release
********************

This page explains how the OpenDaylight release process works once the TSC has
approved a release.

Preparations
============

After release candidate is built gpg sign artifacts using the
`lftools sign <https://lf-releng-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/commands/sign.html>`_
command.

.. code-block:: bash

    STAGING_REPO=autorelease-1903
    STAGING_PROFILE_ID=abc123def456  # This Profile ID is listed in Nexus > Staging Profiles
    lftools sign deploy-nexus https://nexus.opendaylight.org $STAGING_REPO $STAGING_PROFILE_ID

Verify the distribution-karaf file with the signature.

.. code-block:: bash

    gpg2 --verify distribution-karaf-x.y.z-${RELEASE}.tar.gz.asc distribution-karaf-x.y.z-${RELEASE}.tar.gz


Releasing OpenDaylight
======================

- Block submit permissions for registered users and elevate RE's committer
  rights on Gerrit.

  .. figure:: images/gerrit-update-committer-rights.png

  .. note::

     Enable **Exclusive** checkbox for the submit button to override any
     existing persmissions. Code-Review and Verify permissions are only needed
     during version bumping. DO NOT enable it during code freeze.

- Nexus: click release for staging repo
  **(Helpdesk)**

- Nexus: click release for gpgsign repo (created above in Preparations)
  **(Helpdesk)**

- Pull latest autorelease repository
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

  .. note:: If you already cloned autorelease the clone line can be skipped below.

  .. code-block:: bash

      git clone --recursive https://git.opendaylight.org/gerrit/releng/autorelease
      cd autorelease
      git submodule update --init
      git review -s
      git submodule foreach 'git review -s'

- Make sure the latest lftools is installed
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

  .. note:: If you already created an lftools virtualenv you can skip the mkvirtualenv step below.

  .. code-block:: bash

      mkvirtualenv lftools
      workon lftools
      pip install --upgrade lftools

- Publish release tags
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

  .. code-block:: bash

      export RELEASE=Beryllium-SR4
      export STREAM=${RELEASE//-*}
      export BUILD_NUM=55
      export PATCH_URL="https://logs.opendaylight.org/releng/jenkins092/autorelease-release-${STREAM,,}/${BUILD_NUM}/archives/patches.tar.gz"
      ./scripts/release-tags.sh "${RELEASE}" /tmp/patches "$PATCH_URL"

- Run autorelease-version-bump-${STREAM} job
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

- Send email to Helpdesk with binary URL to update website
  **(Helpdesk)**

- Send email to TSC and Release mailing lists announcing release binaries location
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

- Merge all patches generated by the job
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

- Re-enable submit permissions for registered users and disable elevated RE
  committer rights on gerrit
  **(Helpdesk)**

- Send email to release/tsc/dev notifying tagging and version bump complete
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

- Run autorelease-generate-release-notes-${STREAM} job
  **(Release Engineering Team)**

  This job is run a the end of every autorelease build can be used only for
  service releases (SR). The release notes file (release_notes.rst) is available
  under archives. For major releases (Nitrogen, Carbon) the docs repository has
  to branched and published which is only done after release reviews are
  completed.

  Release notes can also be manually generated with the script.

  .. code-block:: bash

      git checkout stable/${BRANCH,,}
      cd scripts/release_notes_management/ && ./build.sh

  The output file (release_notes.rst) generated by the build script is available
  under autorelease/scripts/release_notes_management/projects/.
