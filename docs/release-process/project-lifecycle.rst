This page documents the current rules to follow when adding and removing
a particular project to Simultanneous Release (SR).

List of states
==============

The state names are short negative phrases describing what is missing to progress to the following state.

- non-existent
  The project is not recognized by Technical Steering Committee (TSC) to be part of OpenDaylight (ODL).
- non-participating
  The project is recognized byt TSC to be an ODL project, but the project has not confirmed participation in SR for given release cycle.
- non-building
  The recognized project is willing to participate, but its current codebase is not passing
  its own merge job, or the project artifacts are otherwise unavailable in Nexus.
- failing-distribution-check
  Merge job passes, but project distribution-check job is either not defined or failing.
- not-in-autorelease
  Project distribution-check passes, but the project is not added to autorelease (git submodule, maven module)
- repo-not-in-integration
  Project is added do autorelease, but integration/distribution:features-index is not listing all its feature repositories.
- feature-not-in-integration
  Feature repositories are referenced, but some user-facing features are absent from integration/distribution:features-test
- feature-is-experimental
  All user-facing features are in features-test,
  but at least one corresponding functiona CSIT jobs does not meet integration/test requirements.
- ready

Note that a project may change its state in both directions,
this list is to make sure a project is not left in an invalid state,
for example present in autorelease but without passing distribution-check job.


Fixmes and todos
----------------

- Add links to documents concerning project lifecycle from TSC point of view.
- Add links to M# templates, test rwequirements and other relevant info.
- Mention other jobs involved in verification (verify, validate-autorelease, ... releng-check-poms).
- Add back-references to this document (from integration/distribution, job definition templates, ...).
- Do we need a special rules applicable at Release Review?
- By adding features to integration, distribution-check job may start failing on issues
  that were not visible before. Document a workaround or create a specialized verify-like job.
- Mention that some rules do not make sense for Integration/Distribution project, provide substitute rules.
