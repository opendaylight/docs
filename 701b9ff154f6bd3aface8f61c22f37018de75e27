      "message": "The ServiceUtils infrastructure project is a utility to assist in the operation and maintenance of services provided by OpenDaylight.  A service is a functionality provided by the ODL controller as seen by the operator. Services can be either networking services (e.g. L2, L3/VPN, NAT, etc.) or infra services (e.g. OpenFlow). Services are also provided by the different ODL projects, such as Netvirt, Genius and OpenFlow plugin, and are comprised of a set of Java Karaf bundles and associated MD-SAL datastores.",
