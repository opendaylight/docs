      "message": "I think \"Hydrogen-proposals\" is redundant information considering this file is already in a directory named \"project-proposals\"\n\nCan we simply rename the folder to \"hydrogen\"? Also I\u0027d recommend lower casing filenames since case insensitive file systems have trouble dealing with this.\n\nI\u0027m thinking maybe we should have the filename patch the repo name to keep things simple. In this case this file should be titled \"bgpcep.rst\". Do other docs committers agree?",
