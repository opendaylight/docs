      "message": "Ryan, I went ahead and fixed a minor typo. The prepositional phrase was missing an object, i.e. \"All three of \u003cwhat?\u003e\" I added \"these services\" to fix this and I fixed another minor typo: \"and\" should have been \"an\" later in the sentence. If you approve these changes, I will merge the doc update. Thanks!",
