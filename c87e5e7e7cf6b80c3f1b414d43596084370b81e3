So I think having a version if-statement is likely not the right thing to do here as for each branch we know exactly what the version is set to already.\n\nThis could be as simple as a single variable:\n\n supported \u003d True|False\n\nand we can bump that variable on the required branch when it\u0027s no longer supported.",
